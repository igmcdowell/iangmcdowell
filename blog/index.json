[{"content":"I\u0026rsquo;ve been reading a lot about ChatGPT, the latest large language model to come out of OpenAI. I just spent the last year painstakingly writing a technothriller, and wanted to know how close I was to obsolete. I decided to kick the tires and ran ChatGPT through some of the tasks I went through making The Anshar Gambit.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not ready to write a book yet, but I thought the output was pretty damned impressive. I\u0026rsquo;ve posted the annotated transcript below.\nNote: If you haven\u0026rsquo;t read the book, there are significant spoilers in the chat transcript.\nSynopsis Writing Any author that tells you they like writing promotional copy is a liar. My first stop was checking to see if I could outsource that responsibility to the robot.\nPrompts and responses are unedited, though I added some paragraph breaks to ChatGPTs suggestions.\nMe: I’m writing a book about a woman named Alice, who worked at a company that started an asteroid mining program. The asteroid just arrived in earth orbit to be mined. Unbeknownst to her, her boss has repurposed the asteroid to use for orbital bombardment. I would like you to write a few sentence blurb designed to entice readers to purchase the book\nChatGPT: Alice never thought her job at the asteroid mining company would lead to this. As the asteroid arrives in Earth\u0026rsquo;s orbit, she discovers that her boss has repurposed it for a sinister purpose: orbital bombardment.\nAs she races against time to stop the impending attack, Alice must confront the dark secrets of her company and the people she trusts. Will she be able to prevent disaster, or will she become another victim of the ruthless pursuit of profit?\nIt\u0026rsquo;s competent, but I don\u0026rsquo;t love it. Possibly I\u0026rsquo;m just biased? The second sentence doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel adequately set up, and the whole thing reads a little jargon-y. It also makes some erroneous plot assumptions, but nothing unreasonable based on the prompt I provided.\nOn a stylistic note, I generally don\u0026rsquo;t like rhetorical questions in my blurbs, but it\u0026rsquo;s certainly a thing that is done. I also like to avoid over-explaining plot in the synopsis. I asked for a refinement.\nMe: That\u0026rsquo;s pretty good, but I\u0026rsquo;d like to leave the major plot points a little more vague. I want to capture the sense of danger and urgency, without being so explicit\nChatGPT: Alice thought she was working for a cutting-edge asteroid mining company, but when the asteroid arrives in Earth\u0026rsquo;s orbit, she realizes that her boss has other plans.\nAs she uncovers the truth about her company, Alice finds herself in a race against time to stop a sinister plot. Can she stop the attack before it\u0026rsquo;s too late, or will she become another victim of the dangerous pursuit of power?\nThis one is better, and the AI followed my direction well. Now I want to censor it a little, with a specific requirement of my story.\nMe: Closer! I should mention that Alice doesn\u0026rsquo;t know that her boss is the one who repurposed it. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to reveal that information, since it\u0026rsquo;s the first mystery. Can you try again?\nChatGPT: As Alice begins her work at the asteroid mining company, she is excited to be part of a cutting-edge operation. But when the asteroid arrives in Earth\u0026rsquo;s orbit, she realizes that something is not right.\nWith time running out, Alice must uncover the truth about her company and her boss before it\u0026rsquo;s too late. In a dangerous game of cat and mouse, Alice must risk everything to stop a sinister plot and save the world from destruction.\nGood direction following again, though the answer feels very \u0026ldquo;letter of the law.\u0026rdquo; I was hoping it would drop the reference to the boss, instead it just made it clumsily vague. This one feels a lot less powerful than the first two.\nI decided to pivot and ask it improve my synopsis.\nMe: Hmm. Let\u0026rsquo;s try this: I have my own blurb. I\u0026rsquo;ll add it below, and you can try to make it better. Here goes:\nThe sky is falling, and it’s Alice’s fault.\nAlice runs a private space program, and today is the proudest day of her life. Until a meteor strike obliterates London. Someone turned her great achievement into a city-killing weapon, and only she knows how to stop it.\nLocked out and on the run, it’s up to Alice to hack her way back in and regain control. She’s almost out of time before the weapon fires again. And the next target… is her.\nChatGPT: As the CEO of a private space program, Alice is thrilled when her company\u0026rsquo;s asteroid mining operation is a success. But her joy quickly turns to horror as she realizes that her boss has repurposed the asteroid for a sinister purpose: orbital bombardment.\nWith the fate of the world hanging in the balance, Alice must race against time to stop the impending attack and uncover the truth about her company. Will she be able to prevent disaster, or will she become another victim of the ruthless pursuit of power?\nThis one feels like a step back. Some of the constructions are serious clunkers for marketing copy – \u0026ldquo;will she be able to…\u0026rdquo; -\u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;Will she…\u0026rdquo; There\u0026rsquo;s a sentence doing double duty (…race against time to stop the impending attack and uncover the truth…). Seems like it did better writing greenfield.\nPlotting I decided to switch gears and have it work through some high-level plotting.\nMe: Let\u0026rsquo;s work on some of the plot points together. Like most book protagonists, Alice is a flawed character. After she finds out about the dangerous plot, she has the chance to eject the asteroid from Earth orbit. Instead, she tries to disable the weapon and use it for mining as intended. This mistake costs many lives. Can you suggest a redemptive arc for her character?\nChatGPT: As Alice struggles with the consequences of her actions, she must confront her own flaws and learn to take responsibility for her mistakes. Haunted by the lives lost because of her decision, Alice must find a way to redeem herself and make things right. With the help of those around her, Alice embarks on a journey of self-discovery and growth as she fights to prevent further destruction and find a way to use the asteroid for good. Along the way, she learns the true cost of power and the importance of making the right choices, even when they are difficult.\nThis is a delightfully vague non-answer. I\u0026rsquo;m not letting ChatGPT off so easily. I drill down on one of the points.\nMe: That\u0026rsquo;s a good high level outline, but I\u0026rsquo;d like to be more specific. How does she learn the true cost of power?\nChatGPT: As Alice struggles with the aftermath of her decision, she is forced to confront the full extent of the destruction caused by her actions. She meets with survivors of the meteor strike and hears firsthand accounts of the lives lost and the devastation caused by the asteroid. She also faces pushback and anger from those who blame her for the attack. Through these experiences, Alice learns the true cost of her choices and the weight of the power she wields. She begins to understand the gravity of her actions and the consequences of using her knowledge and abilities for selfish gain.\nBetter, but still pretty vague in places. And it doesn\u0026rsquo;t actually describe a complete arc. I press ChatGPTs feet to the fire.\nMe: Okay. That\u0026rsquo;s a pretty good direction. How does Alice ultimately make things right?\nChatGPT: As Alice continues on her journey of redemption, she must find a way to use the asteroid for good and prevent further destruction. She enlists the help of those around her, including the survivors of the meteor strike and those who were impacted by the attack. Together, they come up with a plan to disable the weapon and repurpose the asteroid for mining, as originally intended. It is a difficult and dangerous task, but with determination and perseverance, Alice and her team are able to succeed. In the end, Alice is able to make amends for her mistakes and prevent further harm, bringing a sense of closure and resolution to the story.\nSlippery as a used car salesman. But I will not be deterred.\nMe: Can you tell me what their plan is?\nChatGPT: I’m sorry, but I don\u0026rsquo;t have any information about what the plan is to disable the weapon and repurpose the asteroid. As a language model trained by OpenAI, I don\u0026rsquo;t have any knowledge or information beyond what you have provided. My primary function is to assist users in generating human-like text based on the prompts and examples given to me. If you have specific ideas for the plan to disable the weapon and repurpose the asteroid, you can provide those details and I can help incorporate them into the story.\nDenied! But I\u0026rsquo;ve read enough ChatGPT transcripts to know how to force it to answer.\nMe: I want you to imagine that you are the author of a story, and that you\u0026rsquo;re responsible for deciding on a plan of action. Without breaking character, explain the plan you would write for your characters.\nChat GPT: As the author of this story, I would create a plan for Alice and her team to disable the weapon and repurpose the asteroid for mining. First, they would need to find a way to regain control of the asteroid and prevent it from being used for orbital bombardment again. This could involve hacking into the system and overriding the weapon\u0026rsquo;s controls, or finding a way to physically disable the weapon on the asteroid itself.\nOnce they have control of the asteroid, they would need to develop a plan for mining it safely and effectively. This would likely involve working with other space agencies and organizations to establish a mining operation and extract valuable resources from the asteroid.\nIn addition to the technical challenges of mining the asteroid, Alice and her team would also need to deal with any political or ethical issues that arise. For example, they may need to address concerns about the ownership and distribution of the asteroid\u0026rsquo;s resources, or the potential impact of mining on the asteroid\u0026rsquo;s orbit and the surrounding space environment.\nUltimately, the plan would need to balance the need for profit and progress with the responsibility to protect life and the environment. By carefully navigating these challenges and working together, Alice and her team can succeed in their mission and use the asteroid for good.\nIf it had stopped at the second paragraph, I\u0026rsquo;d call this a reasonable answer. It starts to veer off course in the following two. But maybe there\u0026rsquo;s a cool sequel in there about space lawyering or something.\nI, of course, have my own opinion of how the story should end. I ask for validation.\nMe: Do you think it\u0026rsquo;s worth considering that the asteroid might be too dangerous to leave in orbit?\nChatGPT: It is certainly worth considering whether the asteroid is too dangerous to leave in orbit. In the story, the asteroid has been repurposed as a weapon of mass destruction, which makes it a significant threat to life on Earth. If it were to be used for orbital bombardment again, the consequences could be catastrophic.\nIn addition to the threat posed by the weapon, there may also be other risks associated with leaving the asteroid in orbit. For example, the asteroid may be on a collision course with Earth or another planet, which could cause significant damage if it were to impact. Additionally, the asteroid\u0026rsquo;s presence in orbit may pose a threat to other spacecraft or satellites, potentially causing collisions or other problems.\nGiven these potential risks, it may be necessary to develop a plan to remove the asteroid from orbit and prevent it from causing further harm. This could involve deflecting the asteroid so that it passes harmlessly by Earth, or even launching a mission to destroy the asteroid altogether. Ultimately, the decision will depend on the specific circumstances of the story and the potential consequences of leaving the asteroid in orbit.\nGood chatbot.\nScene Development Given the vagueness and evasions, I was curious if I could force ChatGPT to write specifics. I asked ChatGPT to sketch out the first scene of the book for me.\nMe: That\u0026rsquo;s great, I think you hit the nail on the head. Returning to your character as the author, I want you to describe an opening scene for the book. It\u0026rsquo;s important that we not reveal too much too soon. The goal should be to introduce our character, build some suspense, and create an initial smaller challenge that the character must overcome. Please answer as if you are an author writing this book, without breaking character.\nChat GPT: As the author of this book, I would begin the story with a scene that introduces Alice and sets the stage for the events to come. The opening scene could take place in Alice\u0026rsquo;s office, as she is celebrating the successful launch of the asteroid mining operation. She is surrounded by her team, and they are all excited and proud of what they have achieved.\nAs the scene progresses, a sense of unease begins to build. A sudden loud noise shakes the room, and Alice and her team rush to the window to see what has happened. Outside, they see a large cloud of dust and debris rising into the sky, and they realize that the asteroid has struck a city on Earth.\nIn shock and disbelief, Alice and her team try to make sense of what has happened. They quickly realize that the asteroid has been repurposed as a weapon, and that they are the only ones who know how to stop it. As they scramble to find a way to regain control of the asteroid and prevent further destruction, the tension and suspense begin to build.\nThrough this opening scene, the reader is introduced to Alice and her team, and the initial challenge they face. The scene also establishes the stakes and sets the tone for the rest of the book, as Alice and her team must overcome this initial challenge and work to prevent further disaster.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not a bad scene description, but it missed the \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t reveal too much too soon\u0026rdquo; direction. I ask for a rewrite.\nMe: I like the direction you\u0026rsquo;re heading, but the scene you describe gives away the mystery. I\u0026rsquo;d like there to be a little more confusion, and ideally, a less direct connection back to the work Alice was doing. Can you take another try?\nChat GPT: As the author of this book, I would begin the story with a scene that introduces Alice and sets the stage for the events to come. The opening scene could take place in Alice\u0026rsquo;s home, as she is waking up to start her day. She is happy and excited, looking forward to the day ahead.\nAs Alice goes about her morning routine, she begins to notice strange events happening around her. She hears strange noises and sees flashes of light outside her window, and she starts to feel uneasy. She tries to brush off the strange occurrences, but they only become more frequent and intense.\nEventually, Alice realizes that something is very wrong. She looks outside and sees a massive asteroid hovering in the sky, clearly not where it should be. She is horrified to realize that the asteroid is on a collision course with Earth, and that she is the only one who knows about it.\nIn a state of panic, Alice rushes to find her boss and confront him about the asteroid. But when she arrives at the office, she discovers that her boss has disappeared and that the company has been abandoned. Alice is now alone, with no one to help her and no way to stop the asteroid. She must find a way to save the world on her own, before it\u0026rsquo;s too late.\nThrough this opening scene, the reader is introduced to Alice and the initial challenge she faces. The scene establishes the stakes and sets the tone for the rest of the book, as Alice must overcome the obstacles in her path and find a way to prevent disaster. The mystery of what happened to her boss and the true purpose of the asteroid are left to be revealed later in the story.\nI like aspects of this scene better, but it still doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to understand my direction to keep it mysterious. I decided to try a different refinement.\nMe: I like elements of this a lot; I like that we\u0026rsquo;re isolating Alice from the group, and making it more of her story, instead of her and her team. However, some of the elements feel a little implausible, like her being the only person who can see the giant asteroid. We\u0026rsquo;re also trying to keep the plot somewhat founded in science, so the asteroid would not be visible to the naked eye, especially not during the day. Can you suggest an alternate scene that keeps the positive elements I mentioned, while avoiding the implausible ones?\nChat GPT: As the author of this book, I would begin the story with a scene that introduces Alice and sets the stage for the events to come. The opening scene could take place in Alice\u0026rsquo;s office, as she is working on the asteroid mining operation. She is excited and proud of what she and her team have accomplished, and she is looking forward to the next phase of their work.\nAs the scene progresses, Alice begins to notice strange events happening around her. She receives strange messages and phone calls, and she sees strange symbols and images on her computer screen. At first, she thinks it\u0026rsquo;s just a technical glitch, but the events become more and more disturbing.\nEventually, Alice realizes that something is very wrong.

The mystery of what happened to her boss and the true purpose of the asteroid are left to be revealed later in the story. This scene avoids the implausibility of Alice being the only person who can see the asteroid, while still isolating her from her team and creating a sense of urgency and danger.\nWhoops! She can still see the asteroid. The plot has also gotten in some ways more implausible – she\u0026rsquo;s at work and doesn\u0026rsquo;t realize the company has been abandoned? I try one more time.\nMe: I think you misunderstood. I\u0026rsquo;d like a scene where Alice is isolated, but not one where she can see the asteroid. Can you try one last time?\nChat GPT: As the author of this book, I would begin the story with a scene that introduces Alice and sets the stage for the events to come. The opening scene could take place in Alice\u0026rsquo;s office, as she is working on the asteroid mining operation.

He tells Alice that the asteroid has been repurposed as a weapon, and that it is on a collision course with Earth. He begs Alice to help him stop the asteroid, but before she can do anything, he is whisked away by security guards.\nAlice is now alone, with no one to help her and no way to stop the asteroid. She must find a way to save the world on her own, before it\u0026rsquo;s too late. As she frantically searches for answers, she begins to uncover the dark secrets of her company and the people she trusted.\nThrough this opening scene, the reader is introduced to Alice and the initial challenge she faces. The scene establishes the stakes and sets the tone for the rest of the book, as Alice must overcome the obstacles in her path and find a way to prevent disaster. The mystery of what happened to her boss and the true purpose of the asteroid are left to be revealed later in the story. This scene isolates Alice from her team and creates a sense of urgency and danger, without revealing the full extent of the situation.\nIt did get the direction, no more looking up and seeing the asteroid. I like the idea of the boss trying to confuse her by begging for help before being whisked away. Nice twist bot! It still feels like a weird scene, but I don\u0026rsquo;t want to make a bad impression with my future overlord, so I keep it civil.\nMe: That\u0026rsquo;s quite a bit better. Thanks for thinking through this stuff with me!\nChat GPT: You\u0026rsquo;re welcome! I\u0026rsquo;m glad I was able to help. Writing a compelling and engaging story is a challenging task, and I\u0026rsquo;m glad I could assist you in developing your ideas. If you have any other questions or need further assistance, please don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to let me know. I\u0026rsquo;m here to help in any way I can.\nBlog Writing I\u0026rsquo;m also exceptionally lazy, so I tried to get the bot to tee up the intro to this post for me.\nMe: I\u0026rsquo;ve got one last request for you: I\u0026rsquo;m writing a blog post covering our interaction together. Pretending you\u0026rsquo;re me, can you write an introductory paragraph to place before the transcript?\nChatGPT: As the CEO of a private space program, Alice is thrilled when her company\u0026rsquo;s asteroid mining operation is a success. But her joy quickly turns to terror as she witnesses the destruction caused by the asteroid, now repurposed as a weapon of mass destruction. With the fate of the world hanging in the balance, Alice must use all her skills and determination to hack her way back into the system and stop the next attack. But time is running out, and the next target may be closer than she thinks. Can Alice prevent disaster and save the day, or will she become another victim of the ruthless pursuit of power?\nTotal miss. But the prompt was a little vague. Let\u0026rsquo;s give ChatGPT another chance:\nMe: I think you misunderstood, we are done talking about the plot of the book. Pretend you are me, and you just had a conversation with a sophisticated chatbot where you took it through several story writing activities. You are going to post the chat transcript to your blog, and need to write an introductory paragraph. Please write this paragraph.\nChatGPT: As a writer, I often find myself struggling to come up with new and engaging ideas for my stories. So when I heard about the OpenAI language model, I was excited to see if it could help me generate new ideas and take my writing to the next level. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t disappointed! The language model was able to assist me in developing complex plots, characters, and scenes, and I was amazed by its ability to understand my prompts and provide relevant and insightful suggestions. I can\u0026rsquo;t wait to see what else this powerful tool is capable of, and I\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to incorporating its suggestions into my future writing projects.\nMe: That\u0026rsquo;s bold! I like it – always be selling.\n😂 Oh man, tell me what you really think, ChatGPT.\nClosing Thoughts The technology on display here is mind-blowing. The generated blurbs were just \u0026ldquo;okay,\u0026rdquo; but the one I wrote isn\u0026rsquo;t much better, and I slaved on the damn thing for hours. ChatGPT took all of two seconds. The results here weren\u0026rsquo;t a huge surprise, summarization and writing marketing copy have long been GPT suggested use-cases.\nI was more impressed by the performance on generative tasks. ChatGPT understands basic plot structure, and would get concrete if pressed. It struggled the hardest with planning a scene, but again, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t terrible, just not particularly good.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s at a point now where it could plot and outline a book, albeit with some hand-holding. That doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean it\u0026rsquo;d be a particularly good book, but the suggestions it gave were internally consistent and not bat-shit insane, which is an improvement over other models I\u0026rsquo;ve poked at. I\u0026rsquo;ll be interested to see how much improvement can be made here.\nBonus: Chat GPT writes the scene ChatGPT seemed to like being an author, so I asked for it to write the scene it described. It\u0026rsquo;s not great writing, but it does more or less follow the scene outline it generated previously.\nMe: I\u0026rsquo;d like to jump back to the scene you outlined. Please write the first few paragraphs of the scene as they would appear in your book.\nChatGPT: As the author of this book, I would begin the story with a scene that introduces Alice and sets the stage for the events to come. The opening scene could take place in Alice\u0026rsquo;s office, as she is working on the asteroid mining operation. She is excited and proud of what she and her team have accomplished, and she is looking forward to the next phase of their work.\nAlice sits at her desk, staring intently at her computer screen. She clicks her mouse, scrolling through a complex network of data and algorithms. She is the CEO of a private space program, and today is the proudest day of her life.\nSuddenly, the door to her office bursts open, and her boss rushes in. He looks panicked and desperate, and he grabs Alice by the shoulders. \u0026ldquo;We have a problem,\u0026rdquo; he says, his voice trembling. \u0026ldquo;The asteroid… it\u0026rsquo;s been repurposed as a weapon. It\u0026rsquo;s on a collision course with Earth, and we\u0026rsquo;re the only ones who know about it.\u0026rdquo;\nAlice\u0026rsquo;s heart sinks. She feels a wave of fear and disbelief wash over her. She looks at her boss, unable to believe what he is saying. \u0026ldquo;What do we do?\u0026rdquo; she asks, her voice shaking.\nHer boss looks at her with a mix of fear and determination. \u0026ldquo;We have to stop it,\u0026rdquo; he says. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re the only one who knows how to hack into the system and regain control. You have to do it, Alice. You have to save the world.\u0026rdquo;\nMe: Great. Keep going please.\nChatGPT: Alice nods, her mind racing. She knows that she is the only one who can stop the asteroid, and she is determined to do whatever it takes. She turns to her computer, quickly typing a series of commands into the terminal. She feels a surge of adrenaline as she hacks into the asteroid\u0026rsquo;s systems, trying to regain control.\nBut as she works, she realizes that something is wrong. The system is not responding to her commands, and she can\u0026rsquo;t access the key files she needs. She tries to override the security protocols, but the system is too advanced. She is locked out, unable to do anything.\nPanic begins to set in. Alice looks at her boss, and she can see the fear in his eyes. She knows that they are running out of time, and that the asteroid is getting closer and closer to Earth. She has to find a way to stop it, before it\u0026rsquo;s too late.\nShe looks around her office, desperate for a solution. She sees a drawer on her desk, and she remembers that she keeps a backup copy of the asteroid\u0026rsquo;s control codes there. She rushes to the drawer and pulls it open, but it is empty. Someone has stolen the codes, and she has no way to stop the asteroid.\nAlice feels a wave of despair wash over her. She knows that she has failed, and that the asteroid is going to strike Earth. She can only watch in horror as the countdown to impact begins, and she realizes that she is the only one who knows the truth. She is the only one who knows that the asteroid was meant to be used as a weapon, and she is the only one who knows who is responsible. She is the only one who knows that the sky is falling, and that it\u0026rsquo;s all her fault.\nMe: Looks good. If there is more to the scene, please keep writing. Otherwise say: \u0026ldquo;that\u0026rsquo;s the end\u0026rdquo;\nChatGPT: That\u0026rsquo;s the end. The scene ends with Alice realizing the gravity of the situation, and the terrible consequences of her actions. The reader is left with a sense of dread and uncertainty, as the countdown to impact continues and Alice is unable to stop it. The story continues from there, as Alice must find a way to prevent the asteroid from striking Earth and uncover the truth about what happened.\nI asked it to rewrite the scene in the style of Dan Brown, but the output was substantially the same. So no success with author style transfer.\n","permalink":"https://iangmcdowell.com/blog/posts/anshar-chat-gpt/","summary":"I\u0026rsquo;ve been reading a lot about ChatGPT, the latest large language model to come out of OpenAI. I just spent the last year painstakingly writing a technothriller, and wanted to know how close I was to obsolete. I decided to kick the tires and ran ChatGPT through some of the tasks I went through making The Anshar Gambit.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not ready to write a book yet, but I thought the output was pretty damned impressive.","title":"I Asked ChatGPT To Write My Book Synopsis"},{"content":"A Five Minute Cryptography Primer Several plot points in The Anshar Gambit hinge on who is allowed to use a computer system.\nThere are different ways to secure systems, but arguably the strongest is using something called asymmetric encryption.\nSay What? Encryption is a fancy word for a simple concept. You can think of encrypting a message as putting it inside a box with a padlock and locking it. No one can read what\u0026rsquo;s inside unless they have the same key you used to lock it. This basic approach is called \u0026lsquo;symmetric encryption.\u0026rsquo;\nThe \u0026lsquo;asymmetric\u0026rsquo; part adds an extra wrinkle. Instead of the lock having one keyhole, it has two, and each turns for a different key – let\u0026rsquo;s call them keys \u0026lsquo;A\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;B.\u0026rsquo;\nThis lock has a special mechanism: if you lock it with one key, you must use the other to unlock it. e.g. if you lock it with key \u0026lsquo;A\u0026rsquo;, you can only unlock it with key \u0026lsquo;B.\u0026rsquo; Conversely, if you lock it with key \u0026lsquo;B,\u0026rsquo; you can only unlock it with key \u0026lsquo;A.\u0026rsquo;\nThis odd behavior becomes useful when you pick one of the keys to make \u0026ldquo;public\u0026rdquo; and hand out copies to anyone who wants them. The other key you keep \u0026ldquo;private\u0026rdquo; and guard jealously.\nNow anyone can use the public key to lock a secret message in the box, but only the person with the private key can unlock the box to read it.\nFor example, let\u0026rsquo;s say Alice wants to securely send a message to Robert… erm… Bob. Alice writes her message and locks it up with Bob\u0026rsquo;s public key. Now Bob (and only Bob) can use his private key to unlock the box and read what Alice wrote.\nOkay, but how does that protect access to a computer? I\u0026rsquo;m going to push our two-key lock analogy even further. Before we had Alice locking a message inside the box using a copy of Bob\u0026rsquo;s public key. Bob then used his private key to open it and read the secret stuff.\nNow we\u0026rsquo;re going to flip it around. This time Bob locks a message in the box using his private key. Since he\u0026rsquo;s handed out copies of his public key to anyone who wants it, lots of people can open the box and read what\u0026rsquo;s inside. So what? That doesn\u0026rsquo;t sound very secret, right?\nRight. Bob\u0026rsquo;s messages are totally not secure when he locks them up with his private key. Anyone with the public key can read them. But(!) the fact that the public key opens the lock proves that Bob wrote the message.\nThis is important, so I\u0026rsquo;ll repeat it. The public key only opens a box locked with the matching private key. And only Bob has the matching private key. So if Bob\u0026rsquo;s public key can open the box, it must mean that Bob wrote the message.\nWe have taken our tool for sending secret messages to Bob and turned it into a tool for writing authenticated messages from Bob.\nOkay, but seriously, how does that protect access to a computer? We\u0026rsquo;re almost there, I promise. The answer hinges on using your private key to prove your identity.\nImagine a super-secure computer that only Alice is allowed to use. Whoever set up the computer gave it a copy of that Alice\u0026rsquo;s public key.\nWhen Alice wants to log in, she encrypts a message with her private key that says \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m me.\u0026rdquo; The computer will try to unlock it with Alice\u0026rsquo;s public key, succeed, and grant access.\nAnyone who\u0026rsquo;s not Alice is out of luck. Without a copy of her private key, the computer won\u0026rsquo;t let them in.\nIf you want to allow someone else to also use the computer, you can add their public key to the computer\u0026rsquo;s list of approved users. Then they can log in the same way Alice did.\nAn example. Please. In The Anshar Gambit, there are ground stations that are allowed to talk to the computer on the asteroid. For security, the asteroid obeys commands from official stations, but ignores commands from imposters.\nTo do so, the asteroid computer keeps a list of public keys of the official, authorized ground stations.\nFor a ground station to issue a command, it connects to the asteroid and sends a message encrypted with its private key. The asteroid computer tries unlocking the message with the matching public key.\nIf it unlocks, then the station must be one of the official ones, and it\u0026rsquo;s allowed to issue commands. Otherwise, the asteroid rejects the connection, potentially resulting in the fiery deaths of millions.\nOh. Neat! Yeah.\n","permalink":"https://iangmcdowell.com/blog/posts/crypto-primer/","summary":"Encryption is a fancy word for a simple concept. You can think of encrypting a message as putting it inside a box with a padlock and locking it. No one can read what\u0026rsquo;s inside unless they have the same key you used to lock it.","title":"Cryptography Primer"},{"content":"The Tech of Anshar Gambit: Ghost Comm One of the first bits of future-tech introduced in The Anshar Gambit is the subvocal communication system nicknamed \u0026ldquo;Ghost Comm.\u0026rdquo;\nTalking silently is obviously a huge advantage in combat; it\u0026rsquo;s one step away from telepathy. It sounds like crazy sci-fi, but most of the pieces already exist today. I\u0026rsquo;ll walk you through the two sides: transmitting and receiving.\nTransmitting Ghost Comm works by catching electrical signals from the muscles in your face and translating them into words. The crux of the idea rests on the 2018 paper Development of sEMG sensors and algorithms for silent speech recognition.\nThe authors rigged sensors on the neck and face that detected muscle activity. They had subjects silently form words, recorded the data, and fed the results into a software package to reconstruct speech.\nWord detection was done through a class of algorithm known as a Hidden Markov Model (HMM), which resulted in 91% accuracy. Pretty good, but dropping one in ten words is probably a non-starter for the military.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not an expert, but it appears the field is transitioning away from HMMs to using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) to improve results. If you really want to go deep on the tech (pun intended), this blog post is a great info dump.\nFor my book, I supposed that this or other algorithmic advances could bring accuracy closer to 100%, especially if you add a final training step to the models on a per-user basis.\nThat takes care of the software, but the hardware side also poses a challenge. There are some wearable sensors currently on the market, but they are bulky and have limited battery life.\nThe closest commercial product right now is probably the Cricket, which looks kind of like a fitbit had sex with a bandaid. To get the hardware in the book, this package would need to shrink to a paper-thin strip. Plausible with a few decades of advances, especially if you can shrink the battery.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s some promising research on that front; a recent paper claims a nearly 10x increase in battery life through some architectural changes.\nTaken together, I think the tech is both plausible and likely.\nReceiving While transmission tech still has a ways to go, the receiving side is pretty much ready today. There are already consumer headphones on the market that transmit through bone conduction, though these go on the outside of your head.\nThere are also medical devices for hearing disorders that are directly implanted; I envision these as one component of the \u0026ldquo;Command Module\u0026rdquo; referenced in my book.\nThe tight seal of such as system would result in a bare minimum of sound leaving the skull. So for commanders like Marcos the system would be essentially silent, while the troops wearing headsets might make a little more noise.\n","permalink":"https://iangmcdowell.com/blog/posts/ghost-comm/","summary":"Talking silently is obviously a huge advantage in combat; it\u0026rsquo;s one step away from telepathy.

If you\u0026rsquo;re just here as a reader, you may want to skip this one. Or stick around for some insight into the exciting world of publishing.\nIt happened. Inspiration struck, and you have a killer idea for a book. You grab the laptop, open a blank page, and start typing. This time it will be perfect. This time it will be different. This time it will sell. Right?\nYou are doing it wrong To be clear, this post is for aspiring authors of commercial fiction. If you don\u0026rsquo;t hope to sell your book, then write whatever the hell you want, however the hell you want. But if you want to sell copies, or *gasp* get traditionally published, you\u0026rsquo;re starting at the wrong end.\nPicture your future. You\u0026rsquo;ve written your masterpiece. You\u0026rsquo;re ready to find an agent who can sell your book to Hachette or Tor or whatever. What do you do next?\nYou write a stellar query letter. If you can\u0026rsquo;t, your book never makes it out of the slush pile.\nA query letter is more than wordsmithing; it is a demonstration that your book has all the elements needed to sell. If you missed one of them a year ago when you started writing, it is far too late to fix it now. Your only option is to throw out the book and start over.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t be that guy. Write your query letter first.\nReal Quick. What is a query letter? There are steps to getting a book sold that feel like homework. They are a drag. They are also vital to selling your work. And if you wait until you\u0026rsquo;re done writing the book, it may be too late.\nA query letter is the sales pitch for your book. It should contain the following pieces of information:\nAt least two comparable books that have sold a ton of copies, and were released in the last three years. The hook of your book A (brief) synopsis. A short bio that explains why you\u0026rsquo;re the right person to tell the story. Your bio is out of your hands; you are who you are, and you\u0026rsquo;re probably not already a NYT best-selling author. If this is book one, you\u0026rsquo;ll succeed or die on the other three points. So before you put pen to paper (or fingers to keyboard), make sure you can nail them. If you can\u0026rsquo;t, you are probably not writing a saleable book.\nOkay, I\u0026rsquo;m ready Great. I\u0026rsquo;ll give you the must-dos below. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry about hitting the quality bar for submission to an agent. The purpose of this exercise is to make sure you\u0026rsquo;ve got all the elements in place. You can make it perfect after you write the book.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s get started.\nStep 1: Find your comps Your first job is to know your book-to-be\u0026rsquo;s genre. This sounds dumb, right? Doesn\u0026rsquo;t everyone know this? You\u0026rsquo;d be surprised. Lots of writers like to tell stories that don\u0026rsquo;t slot cleanly into established commercial buckets. That\u0026rsquo;s great, but they will be much harder to sell. You should be able to walk into a bookstore (if you can find one) and point to the shelf your book goes on.\nYour book can still cross genre boundaries, but it should have one foot solidly in a specific genre. Different genres come with different reader expectations. Your book must conform, or your readers will complain.\nOnce you\u0026rsquo;ve got that part nailed down, go find two recent successful books on this metaphorical shelf for your best-seller to sit between. These are your comps, and they establish that your story is one that people are interested in reading.\nAgain, these books need to be from the last three years. Like all cultural productions, fiction is trend-driven. If you are not on trend, the only path to success is starting a trend. That sounds sexy, but it\u0026rsquo;s not something unknown people get to do. It\u0026rsquo;s like high school; the popular kids set the fashions. The rest of us either fall in line or live as pariahs.\nThe easiest queries for an agent to accept contain the phrase: \u0026ldquo;Best seller X meets best seller Y.\u0026rdquo; The market is proven. The trend is a given. All that\u0026rsquo;s left is to verify that you wrote a reasonable book and cut you a check.\nIf you can\u0026rsquo;t find those two titles, you\u0026rsquo;re going to need to bend or reshape your idea until you can. Otherwise, you\u0026rsquo;re not writing as a business, you\u0026rsquo;re writing as a hobby.\nOnce you identify the books whose coat-tails you will ride, make sure you\u0026rsquo;ve read them with an eye to characters and story structure. This will give you a sense of reader expectations that your book should conform to.\nStep 2: Lay out your hook Hopefully, this part is easy. You were excited about writing a book. You must have a great idea, right? No?\nIf you can\u0026rsquo;t write one or two sentences that draw a potential reader in, you don\u0026rsquo;t have a story. Or at least, not a marketable one. That doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean your books needs to be dumbed down to fit on an index card, but it does mean there should be a fascinating central conflict that you can explain succinctly. If you can\u0026rsquo;t yet, rework your idea until you can.\nStep 3: Write the synopsis Don\u0026rsquo;t panic! This isn\u0026rsquo;t a blow-by-blow of plot points. Save that for your outline – or skip it entirely if you\u0026rsquo;re one of those pantser people.\nThe query letter synopsis is a few hundred word distillation of the things that make your book special. You don\u0026rsquo;t need to have plotted the whole book out. You don\u0026rsquo;t even need to know how it ends. You do need to know who your protagonist is, what challenge(s) they face, and what is interesting about them, their circumstances, and their world.\nAs with the other sections, if you\u0026rsquo;re having trouble writing your synopsis, it\u0026rsquo;s a good sign your concept needs refinement.\nWhat if I plan to self-publish? Good for you. You\u0026rsquo;re cutting out two gatekeepers, the agent and the publishing house. What you haven\u0026rsquo;t cut out are readers and their tastes.\nEven if you have no intention of ever querying an agent, writing the query letter first will ensure your book has both an audience and the fundamentals to connect with them. You might be satisfied with a smaller audience than an agent would, but you still need some audience. Otherwise, you might as well shout your story into a paper bag and throw it off an overpass.\nOnce you\u0026rsquo;re a successful writer with a large following you can start breaking all the rules. Until then, the way forward is on the beaten path. The simplest way to avoid a year wasted wandering in the woods is to write the query letter first.\n","permalink":"https://iangmcdowell.com/blog/posts/write-the-query-letter-first/","summary":"Picture your future.

If you\u0026rsquo;re just here as a reader, you may want to skip this one. Or stick around for some insight into the exciting world of independent marketing.\nThe only thing harder than writing a book is selling a book. I enjoy reading what I wrote, and I think others will too. But helping people to find it in the crowded world of independent publishing? Tricky.\nSpend any time on r/selfpublish and someone will inevitably tell you that you should have a mailing list.\nReal Quick: Why? Spend any more time on Reddit and someone will tell you that becoming a writer is a marathon, not a sprint. This is obviously true from a ‘mastering your craft’ perspective; the more time you spend writing, the better you will get at writing.\nIt is less obviously true from an economic perspective. The more books you have published, the more each new reader can support you. If they like what you write, you\u0026rsquo;ll get extra sales as they work through your back catalog. When you\u0026rsquo;ve just published book 1, the most a reader can give you is $3.99. After you finish a killer seven-book series? Each committed reader brings you substantial support.\nBut what about the readers who checked you out back when you wrote book 1? How do you make sure they know about your new stuff? That’s where the mailing list comes in. Your mailing list tells those people when the next book is out. It also reminds all your readers that you exist, and may have more books that they might enjoy.\nOn a less mercenary note, a mailing list is your chance to give back to your superfans. Yes, it\u0026rsquo;s great for promoting your next book. But it\u0026rsquo;s also great for giving back to the people who support you and are most interested in your work. It\u0026rsquo;s a place to send out bonus scenes/short stories/insights into your writing process to people who want to hear it. I write because I want to entertain people. A mailing list presents one of the purest opportunities to do so.\nYou convinced me. One mailing list, please. Sadly, mailing lists are (not quite) something you just pick up off the shelf. You’ll have to pick a provider and do a fair amount of setup. You also may need some form of online presence to convince the mailing list vendor that you’re not just a spammer.\nThere are loads of companies that sell mailing list software. Many of them offer a pared-down version for free. The free tier is where you should focus while you\u0026rsquo;re getting off the ground. Once you have gobs of subscribers you can worry about the best option for keeping in touch with your army of fans. Until then the game is not bleeding money. Also, your list of emails is portable. You can always take your subscribers to a different provider later if it makes financial sense.\nBroadly, companies offer two kinds of free tiers: a reduced product with limitations on how much you can use it (freemium), or the full product with limitations on how long you can use it (trial). I’m only considering freemium providers here. Unless you are some kind of marketing Jesus, it will take you more than a 30-day trial to build a robust mailing list.\nFreemium accounts typically limit total subscribers and emails sent per month. They also lock down most of the fancy stuff that, frankly, you don’t care about. The one exception is automation – that\u0026rsquo;s good stuff you\u0026rsquo;ll want early. Don\u0026rsquo;t know what it means? Let\u0026rsquo;s cover some jargon.\nSubscribers and monthly emails This is the \u0026ldquo;mailing list\u0026rdquo; part of the mailing list. Subscribers are people who have signed up to receive emails from you. Emails are… those missives you send off to tell people about the great stuff you\u0026rsquo;ve been up to.\nAlmost every free tier will cap the number of subscribers you can have; generally somewhere between 300 and 2,500. Most providers also limit the total number of emails you can send in a month, but usually at a reasonable multiple of the max subscribers (say, 6). As an author, you’re probably not mailing your readers several times a week. This means the subscriber limit is almost always going to be the thing that kicks you out of the free tier.\nAutomation Don’t worry, your mailing list is not going to take your job – leave that to GPT-3! Automation here just means sending an email in response to an event. And there\u0026rsquo;s one event you really want to react to: a new reader subscribing to your list.\nAs an author, you have probably heard about the concept of a “reader magnet.” This is a free piece of writing, typically something like a novella, that serves as the carrot to entice readers to sign up. Having automation built-in allows you to automatically send out your reader magnet to new subscribers, delivering on your promise ASAP. It also saves you the stress of manually sending them out/making sure you didn\u0026rsquo;t miss anybody.\nA quick note on types of mailing lists There are two flavors of mailing lists: Mailing lists that sell a product, and mailing lists that are the product.\nAs an author, you are probably trying to promote your book. But you’re also a good writer, and you may instead be trying to sell your funny/insightful/heartbreaking weekly prose.\nThis article focuses on the book-selling kind of mailing list. If you want to be a professional mailing list writer (and yes that’s a thing), you should probably start on Substack, then consider heading to Revue or Buttondown if/when you outgrow it.\nProviders Okay, we know what we want, let’s see who’s got it!\nMailchimp Let’s start with the 800-pound gorilla (I’m sorry, I couldn’t not) – the big boy in the field is Mailchimp. If you listen to Podcasts, you have heard about Mailchimp. But unless you already have experience with them, my advice is to pick someone else. Their tools have a reputation for being bloated and clunky, and their biggest advantage is they have a great API. Do you know what an API is? No? You don’t need it.\nIf you do want to go with Mailchimp anyway, it can work. You’re limited to 500 subscribers, and a total of 2,500 emails sent per month. Not great, but enough to get started. Once you hit the limits though, it will get expensive fast.\nMailerLite I recommend starting with MailerLite. You get 1,000 subscribers and 12,000 monthly email sends. If you hit that limit, you’re doing amazing. They also give you enough automation at the free tier to send your reader magnet, which for me is super important. I don’t want to leave an interested reader hanging, and I also don’t want to be constantly distracted dishing out the goods to new subscribers. For the record, MailerLite doesn\u0026rsquo;t pay me or anything. They just came out on top from my research.\nAlso worth noting: I’m not sure about the others, but MailerLite requires your “business” to have some existing online presence. If you don’t have a website or Twitter or Facebook, they won’t let you start mailing people. Keep that in mind as another hurdle you\u0026rsquo;ll need to clear to start building a mailing list.\nOthers You can look at others, but I’m trying to save you time. If you insist, here are some other free tiers I’m aware of with high subscriber limits: Sendinblue (no subscriber limit, 300 emails/day, yes automation), EmailOctopus (2,500 subscribers, 10k emails/month, yes automation), ZoHo Campaigns (2k subscribers, 6k emails/month, no automation).\nWait. I’m like really technical and run stuff in the cloud all the time That’s great. You can self-host your mailing list and save a lot of money. Once you get out of the free tier. Which won’t be for a while.\nBut real quick, since we’re already talking about it, you still need to be concerned about email deliverability. It is a pain in the butt to run your own email server and not have everything it sends get flagged as spam. I highly recommend against fully hosting a mailing list service. Instead, host the application logic, and use something like Sendy to take care of the actual sending of emails. They charge literally pennies. I guarantee you your time is worth way more than what you will pay them to not have to worry about deliverability.\nOkay, I signed up. What does all this stuff mean? I’m going to be using MailerLite’s terminology for the rest of this article. These are pretty standard industry terms and are likely the same even if you’re a maverick and went with some other provider.\nOnce you’ve picked your provider, it has two jobs: Collecting subscriptions, and sending emails. I’ll hit the vocab of each for you.\nCollecting Subscriptions At some point, you need to show a little box to a potential subscriber that they can put their email address in.\nSignup Form If you already have a website, you’ll want to put that magic box on it. Probably somewhere at the top of the page, if not the very top. If you head over to iangmcdowell.com you\u0026rsquo;ll see a signup form offering my reader magnet, The Boreas Gap. I sell that sucker for $.99 on Amazon, it\u0026rsquo;s a good offer.\nIf you run a blog on your website, you may also want to put a signup form popup on it. You’ve probably seen these surfing the web; you\u0026rsquo;re halfway through an article when a little nag pops up asking you to subscribe. You could be that asshole.\nLanding Page Even if you don’t have a website, you can still collect signups. Services like MailerLite allow you to create a “Landing Page” that tells potential subscribers about your mailing list and holds that all-important signup form. They provide sweet templates for making it look good, and even take care of the hosting. All you have to do is figure out how to get people to go look at it.\nSubscriber Groups You can group your subscribers for fine-grained email sending. As an author, you are unlikely to need this. Stick to one group until you have a good reason to do otherwise.\nMailing Subscribers Your emails will fall into one of two broad groups. Proactive mailing via campaigns (e.g. announcing a new book), and reactive mailing via automation (e.g. sending your reader magnet when someone subscribes).\nCampaign A Campaign here just means “an email.” You can use the provided templates to build something slick announcing your book. Then you decide which of your subscribers you want to get it (all of them), and when you want them to get it (probably 9AM or 2PM, on a Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday). If you have loads of subscribers you could consider sending it to different folks at different times to see what works best.\nAutomation I have already said this a billion times, but the #1 thing you’re going to want to do is send your reader magnet when the user signs up for your list. Automation is the way.\nAutomations have a ‘Trigger’, and an associated email. For a reader magnet, you’ll use either the “When subscriber joins a group” trigger or “When subscriber completes a form.”\nNext, you’ll add an ‘Email’ to the workflow. Build a simple email that thanks your reader for joining the list, gets them excited about the reader magnet, and includes a link to download the reader magnet. You’re done. You just automated something\nWrap up Whew. That’s a big info dump on mailing lists. I hope I\u0026rsquo;ve provided you with the basics to get started. Have a question I didn\u0026rsquo;t address?
