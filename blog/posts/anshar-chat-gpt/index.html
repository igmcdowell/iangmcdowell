  "articleBody": "I’ve been reading a lot about ChatGPT, the latest large language model to come out of OpenAI. I just spent the last year painstakingly writing a technothriller, and wanted to know how close I was to obsolete. I decided to kick the tires and ran ChatGPT through some of the tasks I went through making The Anshar Gambit.\nIt’s not ready to write a book yet, but I thought the output was pretty damned impressive. I’ve posted the annotated transcript below.\nNote: If you haven’t read the book, there are significant spoilers in the chat transcript.\nSynopsis Writing Any author that tells you they like writing promotional copy is a liar. My first stop was checking to see if I could outsource that responsibility to the robot.\nPrompts and responses are unedited, though I added some paragraph breaks to ChatGPTs suggestions.\nMe: I’m writing a book about a woman named Alice, who worked at a company that started an asteroid mining program. The asteroid just arrived in earth orbit to be mined. Unbeknownst to her, her boss has repurposed the asteroid to use for orbital bombardment. I would like you to write a few sentence blurb designed to entice readers to purchase the book\nChatGPT: Alice never thought her job at the asteroid mining company would lead to this. As the asteroid arrives in Earth’s orbit, she discovers that her boss has repurposed it for a sinister purpose: orbital bombardment.\nAs she races against time to stop the impending attack, Alice must confront the dark secrets of her company and the people she trusts. Will she be able to prevent disaster, or will she become another victim of the ruthless pursuit of profit?\nIt’s competent, but I don’t love it. Possibly I’m just biased? The second sentence doesn’t feel adequately set up, and the whole thing reads a little jargon-y. It also makes some erroneous plot assumptions, but nothing unreasonable based on the prompt I provided.\nOn a stylistic note, I generally don’t like rhetorical questions in my blurbs, but it’s certainly a thing that is done. I also like to avoid over-explaining plot in the synopsis. I asked for a refinement.\nMe: That’s pretty good, but I’d like to leave the major plot points a little more vague. I want to capture the sense of danger and urgency, without being so explicit\nChatGPT: Alice thought she was working for a cutting-edge asteroid mining company, but when the asteroid arrives in Earth’s orbit, she realizes that her boss has other plans.\nAs she uncovers the truth about her company, Alice finds herself in a race against time to stop a sinister plot. Can she stop the attack before it’s too late, or will she become another victim of the dangerous pursuit of power?\nThis one is better, and the AI followed my direction well. Now I want to censor it a little, with a specific requirement of my story.\nMe: Closer! I should mention that Alice doesn’t know that her boss is the one who repurposed it. I don’t want to reveal that information, since it’s the first mystery. Can you try again?\nChatGPT: As Alice begins her work at the asteroid mining company, she is excited to be part of a cutting-edge operation. But when the asteroid arrives in Earth’s orbit, she realizes that something is not right.\nWith time running out, Alice must uncover the truth about her company and her boss before it’s too late. In a dangerous game of cat and mouse, Alice must risk everything to stop a sinister plot and save the world from destruction.\nGood direction following again, though the answer feels very “letter of the law.” I was hoping it would drop the reference to the boss, instead it just made it clumsily vague. This one feels a lot less powerful than the first two.\nI decided to pivot and ask it improve my synopsis.\nMe: Hmm. Let’s try this: I have my own blurb. I’ll add it below, and you can try to make it better. Here goes:\nThe sky is falling, and it’s Alice’s fault.\nAlice runs a private space program, and today is the proudest day of her life. Until a meteor strike obliterates London. Someone turned her great achievement into a city-killing weapon, and only she knows how to stop it.\nLocked out and on the run, it’s up to Alice to hack her way back in and regain control. She’s almost out of time before the weapon fires again. And the next target… is her.\nChatGPT: As the CEO of a private space program, Alice is thrilled when her company’s asteroid mining operation is a success. But her joy quickly turns to horror as she realizes that her boss has repurposed the asteroid for a sinister purpose: orbital bombardment.\nWith the fate of the world hanging in the balance, Alice must race against time to stop the impending attack and uncover the truth about her company. Will she be able to prevent disaster, or will she become another victim of the ruthless pursuit of power?\nThis one feels like a step back. Some of the constructions are serious clunkers for marketing copy – “will she be able to…” -\u003e “Will she…” There’s a sentence doing double duty (…race against time to stop the impending attack and uncover the truth…). Seems like it did better writing greenfield.\nPlotting I decided to switch gears and have it work through some high-level plotting.\nMe: Let’s work on some of the plot points together. Like most book protagonists, Alice is a flawed character. After she finds out about the dangerous plot, she has the chance to eject the asteroid from Earth orbit. Instead, she tries to disable the weapon and use it for mining as intended. This mistake costs many lives. Can you suggest a redemptive arc for her character?\nChatGPT: As Alice struggles with the consequences of her actions, she must confront her own flaws and learn to take responsibility for her mistakes. Haunted by the lives lost because of her decision, Alice must find a way to redeem herself and make things right. With the help of those around her, Alice embarks on a journey of self-discovery and growth as she fights to prevent further destruction and find a way to use the asteroid for good. Along the way, she learns the true cost of power and the importance of making the right choices, even when they are difficult.\nThis is a delightfully vague non-answer. I’m not letting ChatGPT off so easily. I drill down on one of the points.\nMe: That’s a good high level outline, but I’d like to be more specific. How does she learn the true cost of power?\nChatGPT: As Alice struggles with the aftermath of her decision, she is forced to confront the full extent of the destruction caused by her actions. She meets with survivors of the meteor strike and hears firsthand accounts of the lives lost and the devastation caused by the asteroid. She also faces pushback and anger from those who blame her for the attack. Through these experiences, Alice learns the true cost of her choices and the weight of the power she wields. She begins to understand the gravity of her actions and the consequences of using her knowledge and abilities for selfish gain.\nBetter, but still pretty vague in places. And it doesn’t actually describe a complete arc. I press ChatGPTs feet to the fire.\nMe: Okay. That’s a pretty good direction. How does Alice ultimately make things right?\nChatGPT: As Alice continues on her journey of redemption, she must find a way to use the asteroid for good and prevent further destruction. She enlists the help of those around her, including the survivors of the meteor strike and those who were impacted by the attack. Together, they come up with a plan to disable the weapon and repurpose the asteroid for mining, as originally intended. It is a difficult and dangerous task, but with determination and perseverance, Alice and her team are able to succeed. In the end, Alice is able to make amends for her mistakes and prevent further harm, bringing a sense of closure and resolution to the story.\nSlippery as a used car salesman. But I will not be deterred.\nMe: Can you tell me what their plan is?\nChatGPT: I’m sorry, but I don’t have any information about what the plan is to disable the weapon and repurpose the asteroid. As a language model trained by OpenAI, I don’t have any knowledge or information beyond what you have provided. My primary function is to assist users in generating human-like text based on the prompts and examples given to me. If you have specific ideas for the plan to disable the weapon and repurpose the asteroid, you can provide those details and I can help incorporate them into the story.\nDenied! But I’ve read enough ChatGPT transcripts to know how to force it to answer.\nMe: I want you to imagine that you are the author of a story, and that you’re responsible for deciding on a plan of action. Without breaking character, explain the plan you would write for your characters.\nChat GPT: As the author of this story, I would create a plan for Alice and her team to disable the weapon and repurpose the asteroid for mining. First, they would need to find a way to regain control of the asteroid and prevent it from being used for orbital bombardment again. This could involve hacking into the system and overriding the weapon’s controls, or finding a way to physically disable the weapon on the asteroid itself.\nOnce they have control of the asteroid, they would need to develop a plan for mining it safely and effectively. This would likely involve working with other space agencies and organizations to establish a mining operation and extract valuable resources from the asteroid.\nIn addition to the technical challenges of mining the asteroid, Alice and her team would also need to deal with any political or ethical issues that arise. For example, they may need to address concerns about the ownership and distribution of the asteroid’s resources, or the potential impact of mining on the asteroid’s orbit and the surrounding space environment.\nUltimately, the plan would need to balance the need for profit and progress with the responsibility to protect life and the environment. By carefully navigating these challenges and working together, Alice and her team can succeed in their mission and use the asteroid for good.\nIf it had stopped at the second paragraph, I’d call this a reasonable answer. It starts to veer off course in the following two. But maybe there’s a cool sequel in there about space lawyering or something.\nI, of course, have my own opinion of how the story should end. I ask for validation.\nMe: Do you think it’s worth considering that the asteroid might be too dangerous to leave in orbit?\nChatGPT: It is certainly worth considering whether the asteroid is too dangerous to leave in orbit. In the story, the asteroid has been repurposed as a weapon of mass destruction, which makes it a significant threat to life on Earth. If it were to be used for orbital bombardment again, the consequences could be catastrophic.\nIn addition to the threat posed by the weapon, there may also be other risks associated with leaving the asteroid in orbit. For example, the asteroid may be on a collision course with Earth or another planet, which could cause significant damage if it were to impact. Additionally, the asteroid’s presence in orbit may pose a threat to other spacecraft or satellites, potentially causing collisions or other problems.\nGiven these potential risks, it may be necessary to develop a plan to remove the asteroid from orbit and prevent it from causing further harm. This could involve deflecting the asteroid so that it passes harmlessly by Earth, or even launching a mission to destroy the asteroid altogether. Ultimately, the decision will depend on the specific circumstances of the story and the potential consequences of leaving the asteroid in orbit.\nGood chatbot.\nScene Development Given the vagueness and evasions, I was curious if I could force ChatGPT to write specifics. I asked ChatGPT to sketch out the first scene of the book for me.\nMe: That’s great, I think you hit the nail on the head. Returning to your character as the author, I want you to describe an opening scene for the book. It’s important that we not reveal too much too soon. The goal should be to introduce our character, build some suspense, and create an initial smaller challenge that the character must overcome. Please answer as if you are an author writing this book, without breaking character.\nChat GPT: As the author of this book, I would begin the story with a scene that introduces Alice and sets the stage for the events to come. The opening scene could take place in Alice’s office, as she is celebrating the successful launch of the asteroid mining operation. She is surrounded by her team, and they are all excited and proud of what they have achieved.\nAs the scene progresses, a sense of unease begins to build. A sudden loud noise shakes the room, and Alice and her team rush to the window to see what has happened. Outside, they see a large cloud of dust and debris rising into the sky, and they realize that the asteroid has struck a city on Earth.\nIn shock and disbelief, Alice and her team try to make sense of what has happened. They quickly realize that the asteroid has been repurposed as a weapon, and that they are the only ones who know how to stop it. As they scramble to find a way to regain control of the asteroid and prevent further destruction, the tension and suspense begin to build.\nThrough this opening scene, the reader is introduced to Alice and her team, and the initial challenge they face. The scene also establishes the stakes and sets the tone for the rest of the book, as Alice and her team must overcome this initial challenge and work to prevent further disaster.\nIt’s not a bad scene description, but it missed the “don’t reveal too much too soon” direction. I ask for a rewrite.\nMe: I like the direction you’re heading, but the scene you describe gives away the mystery. I’d like there to be a little more confusion, and ideally, a less direct connection back to the work Alice was doing. Can you take another try?\nChat GPT: As the author of this book, I would begin the story with a scene that introduces Alice and sets the stage for the events to come. The opening scene could take place in Alice’s home, as she is waking up to start her day. She is happy and excited, looking forward to the day ahead.\nAs Alice goes about her morning routine, she begins to notice strange events happening around her. She hears strange noises and sees flashes of light outside her window, and she starts to feel uneasy. She tries to brush off the strange occurrences, but they only become more frequent and intense.\nEventually, Alice realizes that something is very wrong. She looks outside and sees a massive asteroid hovering in the sky, clearly not where it should be. She is horrified to realize that the asteroid is on a collision course with Earth, and that she is the only one who knows about it.\nIn a state of panic, Alice rushes to find her boss and confront him about the asteroid. But when she arrives at the office, she discovers that her boss has disappeared and that the company has been abandoned. Alice is now alone, with no one to help her and no way to stop the asteroid. She must find a way to save the world on her own, before it’s too late.\nThrough this opening scene, the reader is introduced to Alice and the initial challenge she faces. The scene establishes the stakes and sets the tone for the rest of the book, as Alice must overcome the obstacles in her path and find a way to prevent disaster. The mystery of what happened to her boss and the true purpose of the asteroid are left to be revealed later in the story.\nI like aspects of this scene better, but it still doesn’t seem to understand my direction to keep it mysterious. I decided to try a different refinement.\nMe: I like elements of this a lot; I like that we’re isolating Alice from the group, and making it more of her story, instead of her and her team. However, some of the elements feel a little implausible, like her being the only person who can see the giant asteroid. We’re also trying to keep the plot somewhat founded in science, so the asteroid would not be visible to the naked eye, especially not during the day. Can you suggest an alternate scene that keeps the positive elements I mentioned, while avoiding the implausible ones?\nChat GPT: As the author of this book, I would begin the story with a scene that introduces Alice and sets the stage for the events to come. The opening scene could take place in Alice’s office, as she is working on the asteroid mining operation. She is excited and proud of what she and her team have accomplished, and she is looking forward to the next phase of their work.\nAs the scene progresses, Alice begins to notice strange events happening around her. She receives strange messages and phone calls, and she sees strange symbols and images on her computer screen. At first, she thinks it’s just a technical glitch, but the events become more and more disturbing.\nEventually, Alice realizes that something is very wrong. She looks outside and sees a massive asteroid hovering in the sky, clearly not where it should be. She is horrified to realize that the asteroid is on a collision course with Earth, and that she and her team are the only ones who know about it.\nIn a state of panic, Alice rushes to find her boss and confront him about the asteroid.

The mystery of what happened to her boss and the true purpose of the asteroid are left to be revealed later in the story. This scene avoids the implausibility of Alice being the only person who can see the asteroid, while still isolating her from her team and creating a sense of urgency and danger.\nWhoops! She can still see the asteroid. The plot has also gotten in some ways more implausible – she’s at work and doesn’t realize the company has been abandoned? I try one more time.\nMe: I think you misunderstood. I’d like a scene where Alice is isolated, but not one where she can see the asteroid. Can you try one last time?\nChat GPT: As the author of this book, I would begin the story with a scene that introduces Alice and sets the stage for the events to come. The opening scene could take place in Alice’s office, as she is working on the asteroid mining operation. She is excited and proud of what she and her team have accomplished, and she is looking forward to the next phase of their work.\nAs the scene progresses, Alice begins to notice strange events happening around her. She receives strange messages and phone calls, and she sees strange symbols and images on her computer screen. At first, she thinks it’s just a technical glitch, but the events become more and more disturbing.\nSuddenly, Alice’s boss bursts into her office, looking panicked and desperate. He tells Alice that the asteroid has been repurposed as a weapon, and that it is on a collision course with Earth. He begs Alice to help him stop the asteroid, but before she can do anything, he is whisked away by security guards.\nAlice is now alone, with no one to help her and no way to stop the asteroid. She must find a way to save the world on her own, before it’s too late. As she frantically searches for answers, she begins to uncover the dark secrets of her company and the people she trusted.\nThrough this opening scene, the reader is introduced to Alice and the initial challenge she faces. The scene establishes the stakes and sets the tone for the rest of the book, as Alice must overcome the obstacles in her path and find a way to prevent disaster. The mystery of what happened to her boss and the true purpose of the asteroid are left to be revealed later in the story. This scene isolates Alice from her team and creates a sense of urgency and danger, without revealing the full extent of the situation.\nIt did get the direction, no more looking up and seeing the asteroid. I like the idea of the boss trying to confuse her by begging for help before being whisked away. Nice twist bot! It still feels like a weird scene, but I don’t want to make a bad impression with my future overlord, so I keep it civil.\nMe: That’s quite a bit better. Thanks for thinking through this stuff with me!\nChat GPT: You’re welcome! I’m glad I was able to help. Writing a compelling and engaging story is a challenging task, and I’m glad I could assist you in developing your ideas. If you have any other questions or need further assistance, please don’t hesitate to let me know. I’m here to help in any way I can.\nBlog Writing I’m also exceptionally lazy, so I tried to get the bot to tee up the intro to this post for me.\nMe: I’ve got one last request for you: I’m writing a blog post covering our interaction together. Pretending you’re me, can you write an introductory paragraph to place before the transcript?\nChatGPT: As the CEO of a private space program, Alice is thrilled when her company’s asteroid mining operation is a success. But her joy quickly turns to terror as she witnesses the destruction caused by the asteroid, now repurposed as a weapon of mass destruction. With the fate of the world hanging in the balance, Alice must use all her skills and determination to hack her way back into the system and stop the next attack. But time is running out, and the next target may be closer than she thinks. Can Alice prevent disaster and save the day, or will she become another victim of the ruthless pursuit of power?\nTotal miss. But the prompt was a little vague. Let’s give ChatGPT another chance:\nMe: I think you misunderstood, we are done talking about the plot of the book. Pretend you are me, and you just had a conversation with a sophisticated chatbot where you took it through several story writing activities. You are going to post the chat transcript to your blog, and need to write an introductory paragraph. Please write this paragraph.\nChatGPT: As a writer, I often find myself struggling to come up with new and engaging ideas for my stories. So when I heard about the OpenAI language model, I was excited to see if it could help me generate new ideas and take my writing to the next level. I wasn’t disappointed! The language model was able to assist me in developing complex plots, characters, and scenes, and I was amazed by its ability to understand my prompts and provide relevant and insightful suggestions. I can’t wait to see what else this powerful tool is capable of, and I’m looking forward to incorporating its suggestions into my future writing projects.\nMe: That’s bold! I like it – always be selling.\n😂 Oh man, tell me what you really think, ChatGPT.\nClosing Thoughts The technology on display here is mind-blowing. The generated blurbs were just “okay,” but the one I wrote isn’t much better, and I slaved on the damn thing for hours. ChatGPT took all of two seconds. The results here weren’t a huge surprise, summarization and writing marketing copy have long been GPT suggested use-cases.\nI was more impressed by the performance on generative tasks. ChatGPT understands basic plot structure, and would get concrete if pressed. It struggled the hardest with planning a scene, but again, it wasn’t terrible, just not particularly good.\nIt’s at a point now where it could plot and outline a book, albeit with some hand-holding. That doesn’t mean it’d be a particularly good book, but the suggestions it gave were internally consistent and not bat-shit insane, which is an improvement over other models I’ve poked at. I’ll be interested to see how much improvement can be made here.\nBonus: Chat GPT writes the scene ChatGPT seemed to like being an author, so I asked for it to write the scene it described. It’s not great writing, but it does more or less follow the scene outline it generated previously.\nMe: I’d like to jump back to the scene you outlined. Please write the first few paragraphs of the scene as they would appear in your book.\nChatGPT: As the author of this book, I would begin the story with a scene that introduces Alice and sets the stage for the events to come. The opening scene could take place in Alice’s office, as she is working on the asteroid mining operation. She is excited and proud of what she and her team have accomplished, and she is looking forward to the next phase of their work.\nAlice sits at her desk, staring intently at her computer screen. She clicks her mouse, scrolling through a complex network of data and algorithms. She is the CEO of a private space program, and today is the proudest day of her life.\nSuddenly, the door to her office bursts open, and her boss rushes in. He looks panicked and desperate, and he grabs Alice by the shoulders. “We have a problem,” he says, his voice trembling. “The asteroid… it’s been repurposed as a weapon. It’s on a collision course with Earth, and we’re the only ones who know about it.”\nAlice’s heart sinks. She feels a wave of fear and disbelief wash over her. She looks at her boss, unable to believe what he is saying. “What do we do?” she asks, her voice shaking.\nHer boss looks at her with a mix of fear and determination. “We have to stop it,” he says. “You’re the only one who knows how to hack into the system and regain control. You have to do it, Alice. You have to save the world.”\nMe: Great. Keep going please.\nChatGPT: Alice nods, her mind racing. She knows that she is the only one who can stop the asteroid, and she is determined to do whatever it takes. She turns to her computer, quickly typing a series of commands into the terminal. She feels a surge of adrenaline as she hacks into the asteroid’s systems, trying to regain control.\nBut as she works, she realizes that something is wrong. The system is not responding to her commands, and she can’t access the key files she needs. She tries to override the security protocols, but the system is too advanced. She is locked out, unable to do anything.\nPanic begins to set in. Alice looks at her boss, and she can see the fear in his eyes. She knows that they are running out of time, and that the asteroid is getting closer and closer to Earth. She has to find a way to stop it, before it’s too late.\nShe looks around her office, desperate for a solution. She sees a drawer on her desk, and she remembers that she keeps a backup copy of the asteroid’s control codes there. She rushes to the drawer and pulls it open, but it is empty. Someone has stolen the codes, and she has no way to stop the asteroid.\nAlice feels a wave of despair wash over her. She knows that she has failed, and that the asteroid is going to strike Earth. She can only watch in horror as the countdown to impact begins, and she realizes that she is the only one who knows the truth. She is the only one who knows that the asteroid was meant to be used as a weapon, and she is the only one who knows who is responsible. She is the only one who knows that the sky is falling, and that it’s all her fault.\nMe: Looks good. If there is more to the scene, please keep writing. Otherwise say: “that’s the end”\nChatGPT: That’s the end. The scene ends with Alice realizing the gravity of the situation, and the terrible consequences of her actions. The reader is left with a sense of dread and uncertainty, as the countdown to impact continues and Alice is unable to stop it. The story continues from there, as Alice must find a way to prevent the asteroid from striking Earth and uncover the truth about what happened.\nI asked it to rewrite the scene in the style of Dan Brown, but the output was substantially the same. So no success with author style transfer.\n",

      I Asked ChatGPT To Write My Book Synopsis
    </h1>
    <div class="post-meta"><span title='2022-12-03 20:17:50 -0800 PST'>December 3, 2022</span>

</div>
  </header> 
  <div class="post-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve been reading a lot about ChatGPT, the latest large language model to come out of OpenAI. I just spent the last year painstakingly writing a technothriller, and wanted to know how close I was to obsolete. I decided to kick the tires and ran ChatGPT through some of the tasks I went through making <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BL2JD1LJ">The Anshar Gambit</a>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not ready to write a book yet, but I thought the output was pretty damned impressive. I&rsquo;ve posted the annotated transcript below.</p>
<p>Note: If you haven&rsquo;t read the book, there are significant spoilers in the chat transcript.</p>
<h2 id="synopsis-writing">Synopsis Writing<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#synopsis-writing">#</a></h2>
<p>Any author that tells you they like writing promotional copy is a liar. My first stop was checking to see if I could outsource that responsibility to the robot.</p>
<p>Prompts and responses are unedited, though I added some paragraph breaks to ChatGPTs suggestions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Me: I’m writing a book about a woman named Alice, who worked at a company that started an asteroid mining program. The asteroid just arrived in earth orbit to be mined. Unbeknownst to her, her boss has repurposed the asteroid to use for orbital bombardment. I would like you to write a few sentence blurb designed to entice readers to purchase the book</p>
<p>ChatGPT: Alice never thought her job at the asteroid mining company would lead to this. As the asteroid arrives in Earth&rsquo;s orbit, she discovers that her boss has repurposed it for a sinister purpose: orbital bombardment.</p>
<p>As she races against time to stop the impending attack, Alice must confront the dark secrets of her company and the people she trusts. Will she be able to prevent disaster, or will she become another victim of the ruthless pursuit of profit?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s competent, but I don&rsquo;t love it. Possibly I&rsquo;m just biased? The second sentence doesn&rsquo;t feel adequately set up, and the whole thing reads a little jargon-y. It also makes some erroneous plot assumptions, but nothing unreasonable based on the prompt I provided.</p>
<p>On a stylistic note, I generally don&rsquo;t like rhetorical questions in my blurbs, but it&rsquo;s certainly a thing that is done. I also like to avoid over-explaining plot in the synopsis. I asked for a refinement.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Me: That&rsquo;s pretty good, but I&rsquo;d like to leave the major plot points a little more vague. I want to capture the sense of danger and urgency, without being so explicit</p>
<p>ChatGPT: Alice thought she was working for a cutting-edge asteroid mining company, but when the asteroid arrives in Earth&rsquo;s orbit, she realizes that her boss has other plans.</p>
<p>As she uncovers the truth about her company, Alice finds herself in a race against time to stop a sinister plot. Can she stop the attack before it&rsquo;s too late, or will she become another victim of the dangerous pursuit of power?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This one is better, and the AI followed my direction well. Now I want to censor it a little, with a specific requirement of my story.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Me: Closer! I should mention that Alice doesn&rsquo;t know that her boss is the one who repurposed it. I don&rsquo;t want to reveal that information, since it&rsquo;s the first mystery. Can you try again?</p>
<p>ChatGPT: As Alice begins her work at the asteroid mining company, she is excited to be part of a cutting-edge operation. But when the asteroid arrives in Earth&rsquo;s orbit, she realizes that something is not right.</p>
<p>With time running out, Alice must uncover the truth about her company and her boss before it&rsquo;s too late. In a dangerous game of cat and mouse, Alice must risk everything to stop a sinister plot and save the world from destruction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Good direction following again, though the answer feels very &ldquo;letter of the law.&rdquo; I was hoping it would drop the reference to the boss, instead it just made it clumsily vague. This one feels a lot less powerful than the first two.</p>
<p>I decided to pivot and ask it improve my synopsis.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Me: Hmm. Let&rsquo;s try this: I have my own blurb. I&rsquo;ll add it below, and you can try to make it better. Here goes:</p>
<p>The sky is falling, and it’s Alice’s fault.</p>
<p>Alice runs a private space program, and today is the proudest day of her life. Until a meteor strike obliterates London. Someone turned her great achievement into a city-killing weapon, and only she knows how to stop it.</p>
<p>Locked out and on the run, it’s up to Alice to hack her way back in and regain control. She’s almost out of time before the weapon fires again. And the next target… is her.</p>
<p>ChatGPT: As the CEO of a private space program, Alice is thrilled when her company&rsquo;s asteroid mining operation is a success. But her joy quickly turns to horror as she realizes that her boss has repurposed the asteroid for a sinister purpose: orbital bombardment.</p>
<p>With the fate of the world hanging in the balance, Alice must race against time to stop the impending attack and uncover the truth about her company. Will she be able to prevent disaster, or will she become another victim of the ruthless pursuit of power?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This one feels like a step back. Some of the constructions are serious clunkers for marketing copy – &ldquo;will she be able to…&rdquo; -&gt; &ldquo;Will she…&rdquo; There&rsquo;s a sentence doing double duty (…race against time to stop the impending attack and uncover the truth…). Seems like it did better writing greenfield.</p>
<h2 id="plotting">Plotting<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#plotting">#</a></h2>
<p>I decided to switch gears and have it work through some high-level plotting.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Me: Let&rsquo;s work on some of the plot points together. Like most book protagonists, Alice is a flawed character. After she finds out about the dangerous plot, she has the chance to eject the asteroid from Earth orbit. Instead, she tries to disable the weapon and use it for mining as intended. This mistake costs many lives. Can you suggest a redemptive arc for her character?</p>
<p>ChatGPT: As Alice struggles with the consequences of her actions, she must confront her own flaws and learn to take responsibility for her mistakes. Haunted by the lives lost because of her decision, Alice must find a way to redeem herself and make things right. With the help of those around her, Alice embarks on a journey of self-discovery and growth as she fights to prevent further destruction and find a way to use the asteroid for good. Along the way, she learns the true cost of power and the importance of making the right choices, even when they are difficult.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a delightfully vague non-answer. I&rsquo;m not letting ChatGPT off so easily. I drill down on one of the points.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Me: That&rsquo;s a good high level outline, but I&rsquo;d like to be more specific. How does she learn the true cost of power?</p>
<p>ChatGPT: As Alice struggles with the aftermath of her decision, she is forced to confront the full extent of the destruction caused by her actions. She meets with survivors of the meteor strike and hears firsthand accounts of the lives lost and the devastation caused by the asteroid. She also faces pushback and anger from those who blame her for the attack. Through these experiences, Alice learns the true cost of her choices and the weight of the power she wields. She begins to understand the gravity of her actions and the consequences of using her knowledge and abilities for selfish gain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Better, but still pretty vague in places. And it doesn&rsquo;t actually describe a complete arc. I press ChatGPTs feet to the fire.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Me: Okay. That&rsquo;s a pretty good direction. How does Alice ultimately make things right?</p>
<p>ChatGPT: As Alice continues on her journey of redemption, she must find a way to use the asteroid for good and prevent further destruction. She enlists the help of those around her, including the survivors of the meteor strike and those who were impacted by the attack. Together, they come up with a plan to disable the weapon and repurpose the asteroid for mining, as originally intended. It is a difficult and dangerous task, but with determination and perseverance, Alice and her team are able to succeed. In the end, Alice is able to make amends for her mistakes and prevent further harm, bringing a sense of closure and resolution to the story.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Slippery as a used car salesman. But I will not be deterred.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Me: Can you tell me what their plan is?</p>
<p>ChatGPT: I’m sorry, but I don&rsquo;t have any information about what the plan is to disable the weapon and repurpose the asteroid. As a language model trained by OpenAI, I don&rsquo;t have any knowledge or information beyond what you have provided. My primary function is to assist users in generating human-like text based on the prompts and examples given to me. If you have specific ideas for the plan to disable the weapon and repurpose the asteroid, you can provide those details and I can help incorporate them into the story.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Denied! But I&rsquo;ve read enough ChatGPT transcripts to know how to force it to answer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Me: I want you to imagine that you are the author of a story, and that you&rsquo;re responsible for deciding on a plan of action. Without breaking character, explain the plan you would write for your characters.</p>
<p>Chat GPT: As the author of this story, I would create a plan for Alice and her team to disable the weapon and repurpose the asteroid for mining. First, they would need to find a way to regain control of the asteroid and prevent it from being used for orbital bombardment again. This could involve hacking into the system and overriding the weapon&rsquo;s controls, or finding a way to physically disable the weapon on the asteroid itself.</p>
<p>Once they have control of the asteroid, they would need to develop a plan for mining it safely and effectively. This would likely involve working with other space agencies and organizations to establish a mining operation and extract valuable resources from the asteroid.</p>
<p>In addition to the technical challenges of mining the asteroid, Alice and her team would also need to deal with any political or ethical issues that arise. For example, they may need to address concerns about the ownership and distribution of the asteroid&rsquo;s resources, or the potential impact of mining on the asteroid&rsquo;s orbit and the surrounding space environment.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the plan would need to balance the need for profit and progress with the responsibility to protect life and the environment. By carefully navigating these challenges and working together, Alice and her team can succeed in their mission and use the asteroid for good.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If it had stopped at the second paragraph, I&rsquo;d call this a reasonable answer. It starts to veer off course in the following two. But maybe there&rsquo;s a cool sequel in there about space lawyering or something.</p>
<p>I, of course, have my own opinion of how the story should end. I ask for validation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Me: Do you think it&rsquo;s worth considering that the asteroid might be too dangerous to leave in orbit?</p>
<p>ChatGPT: It is certainly worth considering whether the asteroid is too dangerous to leave in orbit. In the story, the asteroid has been repurposed as a weapon of mass destruction, which makes it a significant threat to life on Earth. If it were to be used for orbital bombardment again, the consequences could be catastrophic.</p>
<p>In addition to the threat posed by the weapon, there may also be other risks associated with leaving the asteroid in orbit. For example, the asteroid may be on a collision course with Earth or another planet, which could cause significant damage if it were to impact. Additionally, the asteroid&rsquo;s presence in orbit may pose a threat to other spacecraft or satellites, potentially causing collisions or other problems.</p>
<p>Given these potential risks, it may be necessary to develop a plan to remove the asteroid from orbit and prevent it from causing further harm. This could involve deflecting the asteroid so that it passes harmlessly by Earth, or even launching a mission to destroy the asteroid altogether. Ultimately, the decision will depend on the specific circumstances of the story and the potential consequences of leaving the asteroid in orbit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Good chatbot.</p>
<h2 id="scene-development">Scene Development<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#scene-development">#</a></h2>
<p>Given the vagueness and evasions, I was curious if I could force ChatGPT to write specifics. I asked ChatGPT to sketch out the first scene of the book for me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Me: That&rsquo;s great, I think you hit the nail on the head. Returning to your character as the author, I want you to describe an opening scene for the book. It&rsquo;s important that we not reveal too much too soon. The goal should be to introduce our character, build some suspense, and create an initial smaller challenge that the character must overcome. Please answer as if you are an author writing this book, without breaking character.</p>
<p>Chat GPT: As the author of this book, I would begin the story with a scene that introduces Alice and sets the stage for the events to come. The opening scene could take place in Alice&rsquo;s office, as she is celebrating the successful launch of the asteroid mining operation. She is surrounded by her team, and they are all excited and proud of what they have achieved.</p>
<p>As the scene progresses, a sense of unease begins to build. A sudden loud noise shakes the room, and Alice and her team rush to the window to see what has happened. Outside, they see a large cloud of dust and debris rising into the sky, and they realize that the asteroid has struck a city on Earth.</p>
<p>In shock and disbelief, Alice and her team try to make sense of what has happened. They quickly realize that the asteroid has been repurposed as a weapon, and that they are the only ones who know how to stop it. As they scramble to find a way to regain control of the asteroid and prevent further destruction, the tension and suspense begin to build.</p>
<p>Through this opening scene, the reader is introduced to Alice and her team, and the initial challenge they face. The scene also establishes the stakes and sets the tone for the rest of the book, as Alice and her team must overcome this initial challenge and work to prevent further disaster.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a bad scene description, but it missed the &ldquo;don&rsquo;t reveal too much too soon&rdquo; direction. I ask for a rewrite.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Me: I like the direction you&rsquo;re heading, but the scene you describe gives away the mystery. I&rsquo;d like there to be a little more confusion, and ideally, a less direct connection back to the work Alice was doing. Can you take another try?</p>
<p>Chat GPT: As the author of this book, I would begin the story with a scene that introduces Alice and sets the stage for the events to come. The opening scene could take place in Alice&rsquo;s home, as she is waking up to start her day. She is happy and excited, looking forward to the day ahead.</p>
<p>As Alice goes about her morning routine, she begins to notice strange events happening around her. She hears strange noises and sees flashes of light outside her window, and she starts to feel uneasy. She tries to brush off the strange occurrences, but they only become more frequent and intense.</p>
<p>Eventually, Alice realizes that something is very wrong. She looks outside and sees a massive asteroid hovering in the sky, clearly not where it should be. She is horrified to realize that the asteroid is on a collision course with Earth, and that she is the only one who knows about it.</p>
<p>In a state of panic, Alice rushes to find her boss and confront him about the asteroid. But when she arrives at the office, she discovers that her boss has disappeared and that the company has been abandoned. Alice is now alone, with no one to help her and no way to stop the asteroid. She must find a way to save the world on her own, before it&rsquo;s too late.</p>
<p>Through this opening scene, the reader is introduced to Alice and the initial challenge she faces. The scene establishes the stakes and sets the tone for the rest of the book, as Alice must overcome the obstacles in her path and find a way to prevent disaster. The mystery of what happened to her boss and the true purpose of the asteroid are left to be revealed later in the story.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I like aspects of this scene better, but it still doesn&rsquo;t seem to understand my direction to keep it mysterious. I decided to try a different refinement.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Me: I like elements of this a lot; I like that we&rsquo;re isolating Alice from the group, and making it more of her story, instead of her and her team. However, some of the elements feel a little implausible, like her being the only person who can see the giant asteroid. We&rsquo;re also trying to keep the plot somewhat founded in science, so the asteroid would not be visible to the naked eye, especially not during the day. Can you suggest an alternate scene that keeps the positive elements I mentioned, while avoiding the implausible ones?</p>

The opening scene could take place in Alice&rsquo;s office, as she is working on the asteroid mining operation. She is excited and proud of what she and her team have accomplished, and she is looking forward to the next phase of their work.</p>
<p>As the scene progresses, Alice begins to notice strange events happening around her. She receives strange messages and phone calls, and she sees strange symbols and images on her computer screen. At first, she thinks it&rsquo;s just a technical glitch, but the events become more and more disturbing.</p>

This scene avoids the implausibility of Alice being the only person who can see the asteroid, while still isolating her from her team and creating a sense of urgency and danger.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whoops! She can still see the asteroid. The plot has also gotten in some ways more implausible – she&rsquo;s at work and doesn&rsquo;t realize the company has been abandoned? I try one more time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Me: I think you misunderstood. I&rsquo;d like a scene where Alice is isolated, but not one where she can see the asteroid. Can you try one last time?</p>

<p>Suddenly, Alice&rsquo;s boss bursts into her office, looking panicked and desperate. He tells Alice that the asteroid has been repurposed as a weapon, and that it is on a collision course with Earth. He begs Alice to help him stop the asteroid, but before she can do anything, he is whisked away by security guards.</p>
<p>Alice is now alone, with no one to help her and no way to stop the asteroid. She must find a way to save the world on her own, before it&rsquo;s too late. As she frantically searches for answers, she begins to uncover the dark secrets of her company and the people she trusted.</p>

This scene isolates Alice from her team and creates a sense of urgency and danger, without revealing the full extent of the situation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It did get the direction, no more looking up and seeing the asteroid. I like the idea of the boss trying to confuse her by begging for help before being whisked away. Nice twist bot! It still feels like a weird scene, but I don&rsquo;t want to make a bad impression with my future overlord, so I keep it civil.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Me: That&rsquo;s quite a bit better. Thanks for thinking through this stuff with me!</p>
<p>Chat GPT: You&rsquo;re welcome! I&rsquo;m glad I was able to help. Writing a compelling and engaging story is a challenging task, and I&rsquo;m glad I could assist you in developing your ideas. If you have any other questions or need further assistance, please don&rsquo;t hesitate to let me know. I&rsquo;m here to help in any way I can.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also exceptionally lazy, so I tried to get the bot to tee up the intro to this post for me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Me: I&rsquo;ve got one last request for you: I&rsquo;m writing a blog post covering our interaction together. Pretending you&rsquo;re me, can you write an introductory paragraph to place before the transcript?</p>
<p>ChatGPT: As the CEO of a private space program, Alice is thrilled when her company&rsquo;s asteroid mining operation is a success. But her joy quickly turns to terror as she witnesses the destruction caused by the asteroid, now repurposed as a weapon of mass destruction. With the fate of the world hanging in the balance, Alice must use all her skills and determination to hack her way back into the system and stop the next attack. But time is running out, and the next target may be closer than she thinks. Can Alice prevent disaster and save the day, or will she become another victim of the ruthless pursuit of power?</p>

<p>Total miss. But the prompt was a little vague. Let&rsquo;s give ChatGPT another chance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Me: I think you misunderstood, we are done talking about the plot of the book. Pretend you are me, and you just had a conversation with a sophisticated chatbot where you took it through several story writing activities. You are going to post the chat transcript to your blog, and need to write an introductory paragraph. Please write this paragraph.</p>
<p>ChatGPT: As a writer, I often find myself struggling to come up with new and engaging ideas for my stories. So when I heard about the OpenAI language model, I was excited to see if it could help me generate new ideas and take my writing to the next level. I wasn&rsquo;t disappointed! The language model was able to assist me in developing complex plots, characters, and scenes, and I was amazed by its ability to understand my prompts and provide relevant and insightful suggestions. I can&rsquo;t wait to see what else this powerful tool is capable of, and I&rsquo;m looking forward to incorporating its suggestions into my future writing projects.</p>
<p>Me: That&rsquo;s bold! I like it – always be selling.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>😂 Oh man, tell me what you really think, ChatGPT.</p>

<p>The technology on display here is mind-blowing. The generated blurbs were just &ldquo;okay,&rdquo; but the one I wrote isn&rsquo;t much better, and I slaved on the damn thing for hours. ChatGPT took all of two seconds. The results here weren&rsquo;t a huge surprise, summarization and writing marketing copy have long been GPT suggested use-cases.</p>
<p>I was more impressed by the performance on generative tasks. ChatGPT understands basic plot structure, and would get concrete if pressed. It struggled the hardest with planning a scene, but again, it wasn&rsquo;t terrible, just not particularly good.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s at a point now where it could plot and outline a book, albeit with some hand-holding. That doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;d be a particularly good book, but the suggestions it gave were internally consistent and not bat-shit insane, which is an improvement over other models I&rsquo;ve poked at. I&rsquo;ll be interested to see how much improvement can be made here.</p>

<p>ChatGPT seemed to like being an author, so I asked for it to write the scene it described. It&rsquo;s not great writing, but it does more or less follow the scene outline it generated previously.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Me: I&rsquo;d like to jump back to the scene you outlined. Please write the first few paragraphs of the scene as they would appear in your book.</p>
<p>ChatGPT: As the author of this book, I would begin the story with a scene that introduces Alice and sets the stage for the events to come. The opening scene could take place in Alice&rsquo;s office, as she is working on the asteroid mining operation. She is excited and proud of what she and her team have accomplished, and she is looking forward to the next phase of their work.</p>
<p>Alice sits at her desk, staring intently at her computer screen. She clicks her mouse, scrolling through a complex network of data and algorithms. She is the CEO of a private space program, and today is the proudest day of her life.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the door to her office bursts open, and her boss rushes in. He looks panicked and desperate, and he grabs Alice by the shoulders. &ldquo;We have a problem,&rdquo; he says, his voice trembling. &ldquo;The asteroid… it&rsquo;s been repurposed as a weapon. It&rsquo;s on a collision course with Earth, and we&rsquo;re the only ones who know about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alice&rsquo;s heart sinks. She feels a wave of fear and disbelief wash over her. She looks at her boss, unable to believe what he is saying. &ldquo;What do we do?&rdquo; she asks, her voice shaking.</p>
<p>Her boss looks at her with a mix of fear and determination. &ldquo;We have to stop it,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the only one who knows how to hack into the system and regain control. You have to do it, Alice. You have to save the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Me: Great. Keep going please.</p>
<p>ChatGPT: Alice nods, her mind racing. She knows that she is the only one who can stop the asteroid, and she is determined to do whatever it takes. She turns to her computer, quickly typing a series of commands into the terminal. She feels a surge of adrenaline as she hacks into the asteroid&rsquo;s systems, trying to regain control.</p>
<p>But as she works, she realizes that something is wrong. The system is not responding to her commands, and she can&rsquo;t access the key files she needs. She tries to override the security protocols, but the system is too advanced. She is locked out, unable to do anything.</p>
<p>Panic begins to set in. Alice looks at her boss, and she can see the fear in his eyes. She knows that they are running out of time, and that the asteroid is getting closer and closer to Earth. She has to find a way to stop it, before it&rsquo;s too late.</p>
<p>She looks around her office, desperate for a solution. She sees a drawer on her desk, and she remembers that she keeps a backup copy of the asteroid&rsquo;s control codes there. She rushes to the drawer and pulls it open, but it is empty. Someone has stolen the codes, and she has no way to stop the asteroid.</p>
<p>Alice feels a wave of despair wash over her. She knows that she has failed, and that the asteroid is going to strike Earth. She can only watch in horror as the countdown to impact begins, and she realizes that she is the only one who knows the truth. She is the only one who knows that the asteroid was meant to be used as a weapon, and she is the only one who knows who is responsible. She is the only one who knows that the sky is falling, and that it&rsquo;s all her fault.</p>
<p>Me: Looks good. If there is more to the scene, please keep writing. Otherwise say: &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the end&rdquo;</p>
<p>ChatGPT: That&rsquo;s the end. The scene ends with Alice realizing the gravity of the situation, and the terrible consequences of her actions. The reader is left with a sense of dread and uncertainty, as the countdown to impact continues and Alice is unable to stop it. The story continues from there, as Alice must find a way to prevent the asteroid from striking Earth and uncover the truth about what happened.</p>

<p>I asked it to rewrite the scene in the style of Dan Brown, but the output was substantially the same. So no success with author style transfer.</p>
