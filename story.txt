The sky is falling, and it's Alice's fault.

Alice woke up a high-powered executive, head of a private space program. She’s about to become an accomplice to the murder of millions – she just doesn’t know it yet.

When her helicopter locks up high above the English channel, it seems like a typical software bug. Until the shockwave hits. There’s a perfectly good reason the autopilot crashed:

London has just been obliterated.

Someone turned Alice’s breakthrough technology into a city-killing weapon. Now only she can shut it down. 

Alice is almost out of time before the weapon fires again. And the next target… is her.

The Anshar Gambit is a heart-pounding near-future technothriller that will leave you breathless.
