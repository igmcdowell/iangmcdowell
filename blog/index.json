[{"content":"Note: This is another post for authors. If you\u0026rsquo;re just here as a reader, you may want to skip this one. Or stick around for some insight into the exciting world of publishing.\nIt happened. Inspiration struck, and you have a killer idea for a book. You grab the laptop, open a blank page, and start typing. This time it will be perfect. This time it will be different. This time it will sell. Right?\nYou are doing it wrong To be clear, this post is for aspiring authors of commercial fiction. If you don\u0026rsquo;t hope to sell your book, then write whatever the hell you want, however the hell you want. But if you want to sell copies, or *gasp* get traditionally published, you\u0026rsquo;re starting at the wrong end.\nPicture your future. You\u0026rsquo;ve written your masterpiece. You\u0026rsquo;re ready to find an agent who can sell your book to Hachette or Tor or whatever. What do you do next?\nYou write a stellar query letter. If you can\u0026rsquo;t, your book never makes it out of the slush pile.\nA query letter is more than wordsmithing; it is a demonstration that your book has all the elements needed to sell. If you missed one of them a year ago when you started writing, it is far too late to fix it now. Your only option is to throw out the book and start over.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t be that guy. Write your query letter first.\nReal Quick. What is a query letter? There are steps to getting a book sold that feel like homework. They are a drag. They are also vital to selling your work. And if you wait until you\u0026rsquo;re done writing the book, it may be too late.\nA query letter is the sales pitch for your book. It should contain the following pieces of information:\nAt least two comparable books that have sold a ton of copies, and were released in the last three years. The hook of your book A (brief) synopsis. A short bio that explains why you\u0026rsquo;re the right person to tell the story. Your bio is out of your hands; you are who you are, and you\u0026rsquo;re probably not already a NYT best-selling author. If this is book one, you\u0026rsquo;ll succeed or die on the other three points. So before you put pen to paper (or fingers to keyboard), make sure you can nail them. If you can\u0026rsquo;t, you are probably not writing a saleable book.\nOkay, I\u0026rsquo;m ready Great. I\u0026rsquo;ll give you the must-dos below. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry about hitting the quality bar for submission to an agent. The purpose of this exercise is to make sure you\u0026rsquo;ve got all the elements in place. You can make it perfect after you write the book.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s get started.\nStep 1: Find your comps Your first job is to know your book-to-be\u0026rsquo;s genre. This sounds dumb, right? Doesn\u0026rsquo;t everyone know this? You\u0026rsquo;d be surprised. Lots of writers like to tell stories that don\u0026rsquo;t slot cleanly into established commercial buckets. That\u0026rsquo;s great, but they will be much harder to sell. You should be able to walk into a bookstore (if you can find one) and point to the shelf your book goes on.\nYour book can still cross genre boundaries, but it should have one foot solidly in a specific genre. Different genres come with different reader expectations. Your book must conform, or your readers will complain.\nOnce you\u0026rsquo;ve got that part nailed down, go find two successful books on this metaphorical shelf for your best-seller to sit between. These are your comps, and they establish that your story is one that people are interested in reading.\nLike all cultural productions, publishing is trend-driven. If you are not on trend, the only path to success is starting a trend. That sounds sexy, but it\u0026rsquo;s not something unknown people get to do. It\u0026rsquo;s like high school, the popular kids get to shape fashion. The rest of us need to fall in line or be pariahs.\nThe easiest queries for an agent to accept are \u0026ldquo;Best seller X meets best seller Y.\u0026rdquo; The market is proven. The trend is a given. All that\u0026rsquo;s left is to verify that you wrote a reasonable book and cut you a check.\nIf you can\u0026rsquo;t find those two titles, you\u0026rsquo;re going to need to bend or reshape your idea until you can. Otherwise, you\u0026rsquo;re not writing as a business, you\u0026rsquo;re writing as a hobby.\nOnce you identify the books whose coat-tails you will ride, make sure you\u0026rsquo;ve read them with an eye to characters and story structure. This will give you a sense of reader expectations that your book should conform to.\nStep 2: Lay out your hook Hopefully, this part is easy. You were excited about writing a book. You must have a great idea, right? No?\nIf you can\u0026rsquo;t write one or two sentences that draw a potential reader in, you don\u0026rsquo;t have a story. Or at least, not a marketable one. That doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean your books needs to be dumbed down to fit on an index card, but it does mean there should be a fascinating central conflict that you can explain succinctly. If you can\u0026rsquo;t yet, rework your idea until you can.\nStep 3: Write the synopsis Don\u0026rsquo;t panic! This isn\u0026rsquo;t a blow-by-blow of plot points. Save that for your outline – or skip it entirely if you\u0026rsquo;re one of those pantser people.\nThe query letter synopsis is a few hundred word distillation of the things that make your book special. You don\u0026rsquo;t need to have plotted the whole book out. You don\u0026rsquo;t even need to know how it ends. You do need to know who your protagonist is, what challenge(s) they face, and what is special about them, their circumstances, and their world.\nAs with the other sections, if you\u0026rsquo;re having trouble writing your synopsis, it\u0026rsquo;s a good sign your concept needs refinement.\nWhat if I plan to self-publish? Good for you. You\u0026rsquo;re cutting out two gatekeepers, the agent and the publishing house. What you haven\u0026rsquo;t cut out are readers and their tastes.\nEven if you have no intention of ever querying an agent, writing the query letter first will ensure your book has both an audience and the fundamentals to connect with them. You might be satisfied with a smaller audience than an agent would, but you still need some audience. Otherwise, you might as well shout your story into a paper bag and throw it off an overpass.\nOnce you\u0026rsquo;re a successful writer with a large following you can start breaking all the rules. Until then, the way forward is on the beaten path. The easiest way to avoid a year wasted wandering in the woods is to write the query letter first.\n","permalink":"http://iangmcdowell.com/blog/posts/write-the-query-letter-first/","summary":"Note: This is another post for authors.

If you\u0026rsquo;re just here as a reader, you may want to skip this one. Or stick around for some insight into the exciting world of independent marketing.\nThe only thing harder than writing a book is selling a book. I enjoy reading what I wrote, and I think others will too. But helping people to find it in the crowded world of independent publishing? Tricky.\nSpend any time on r/selfpublish and someone will inevitably tell you that you should have a mailing list.\nReal Quick: Why? Spend any more time on Reddit and someone will tell you that becoming a writer is a marathon, not a sprint. This is obviously true from a ‘mastering your craft’ perspective; the more time you spend writing, the better you will get at writing.\nIt is less obviously true from an economic perspective. The more books you have published, the more each new reader can support you. If they like what you write, you\u0026rsquo;ll get extra sales as they work through your back catalog. When you\u0026rsquo;ve just published book 1, the most a reader can give you is $3.99. After you finish a killer seven-book series? Each committed reader brings you substantial support.\nBut what about the readers who checked you out back when you wrote book 1? How do you make sure they know about your new stuff? That’s where the mailing list comes in. Your mailing list tells those people when the next book is out. It also reminds all your readers that you exist, and may have more books that they might enjoy.\nOn a less mercenary note, a mailing list is your chance to give back to your superfans. Yes, it\u0026rsquo;s great for promoting your next book. But it\u0026rsquo;s also great for giving back to the people who support you and are most interested in your work. It\u0026rsquo;s a place to send out bonus scenes/short stories/insights into your writing process to people who want to hear it. I write because I want to entertain people. A mailing list presents one of the purest opportunities to do so.\nYou convinced me. One mailing list, please. Sadly, mailing lists are (not quite) something you just pick up off the shelf. You’ll have to pick a provider and do a fair amount of setup. You also may need some form of online presence to convince the mailing list vendor that you’re not just a spammer.\nThere are loads of companies that sell mailing list software. Many of them offer a pared-down version for free. The free tier is where you should focus while you\u0026rsquo;re getting off the ground. Once you have gobs of subscribers you can worry about the best option for keeping in touch with your army of fans. Until then the game is not bleeding money. Also, your list of emails is portable. You can always take your subscribers to a different provider later if it makes financial sense.\nBroadly, companies offer two kinds of free tiers: a reduced product with limitations on how much you can use it (freemium), or the full product with limitations on how long you can use it (trial). I’m only considering freemium providers here. Unless you are some kind of marketing Jesus, it will take you more than a 30-day trial to build a robust mailing list.\nFreemium accounts typically limit total subscribers and emails sent per month. They also lock down most of the fancy stuff that, frankly, you don’t care about. The one exception is automation – that\u0026rsquo;s good stuff you\u0026rsquo;ll want early. Don\u0026rsquo;t know what it means? Let\u0026rsquo;s cover some jargon.\nSubscribers and monthly emails This is the \u0026ldquo;mailing list\u0026rdquo; part of the mailing list. Subscribers are people who have signed up to receive emails from you. Emails are… those missives you send off to tell people about the great stuff you\u0026rsquo;ve been up to.\nAlmost every free tier will cap the number of subscribers you can have; generally somewhere between 300 and 2,500. Most providers also limit the total number of emails you can send in a month, but usually at a reasonable multiple of the max subscribers (say, 6). As an author, you’re probably not mailing your readers several times a week. This means the subscriber limit is almost always going to be the thing that kicks you out of the free tier.\nAutomation Don’t worry, your mailing list is not going to take your job – leave that to GPT-3! Automation here just means sending an email in response to an event. And there\u0026rsquo;s one event you really want to react to: a new reader subscribing to your list.\nAs an author, you have probably heard about the concept of a “reader magnet.” This is a free piece of writing, typically something like a novella, that serves as the carrot to entice readers to sign up. Having automation built-in allows you to automatically send out your reader magnet to new subscribers, delivering on your promise ASAP. It also saves you the stress of manually sending them out/making sure you didn\u0026rsquo;t miss anybody.\nA quick note on types of mailing lists There are two flavors of mailing lists: Mailing lists that sell a product, and mailing lists that are the product.\nAs an author, you are probably trying to promote your book. But you’re also a good writer, and you may instead be trying to sell your funny/insightful/heartbreaking weekly prose.\nThis article focuses on the book-selling kind of mailing list. If you want to be a professional mailing list writer (and yes that’s a thing), you should probably start on Substack, then consider heading to Revue or Buttondown if/when you outgrow it.\nProviders Okay, we know what we want, let’s see who’s got it!\nMailchimp Let’s start with the 800-pound gorilla (I’m sorry, I couldn’t not) – the big boy in the field is Mailchimp. If you listen to Podcasts, you have heard about Mailchimp. But unless you already have experience with them, my advice is to pick someone else. Their tools have a reputation for being bloated and clunky, and their biggest advantage is they have a great API. Do you know what an API is? No? You don’t need it.\nIf you do want to go with Mailchimp anyway, it can work. You’re limited to 500 subscribers, and a total of 2,500 emails sent per month. Not great, but enough to get started. Once you hit the limits though, it will get expensive fast.\nMailerLite I recommend starting with MailerLite. You get 1,000 subscribers and 12,000 monthly email sends. If you hit that limit, you’re doing amazing. They also give you enough automation at the free tier to send your reader magnet, which for me is super important. I don’t want to leave an interested reader hanging, and I also don’t want to be constantly distracted dishing out the goods to new subscribers. For the record, MailerLite doesn\u0026rsquo;t pay me or anything. They just came out on top from my research.\nAlso worth noting: I’m not sure about the others, but MailerLite requires your “business” to have some existing online presence. If you don’t have a website or Twitter or Facebook, they won’t let you start mailing people. Keep that in mind as another hurdle you\u0026rsquo;ll need to clear to start building a mailing list.\nOthers You can look at others, but I’m trying to save you time. If you insist, here are some other free tiers I’m aware of with high subscriber limits: Sendinblue (no subscriber limit, 300 emails/day, yes automation), EmailOctopus (2,500 subscribers, 10k emails/month, yes automation), ZoHo Campaigns (2k subscribers, 6k emails/month, no automation).\nWait. I’m like really technical and run stuff in the cloud all the time That’s great. You can self-host your mailing list and save a lot of money. Once you get out of the free tier. Which won’t be for a while.\nBut real quick, since we’re already talking about it, you still need to be concerned about email deliverability. It is a pain in the butt to run your own email server and not have everything it sends get flagged as spam. I highly recommend against fully hosting a mailing list service. Instead, host the application logic, and use something like Sendy to take care of the actual sending of emails. They charge literally pennies. I guarantee you your time is worth way more than what you will pay them to not have to worry about deliverability.\nOkay, I signed up. What does all this stuff mean? I’m going to be using MailerLite’s terminology for the rest of this article. These are pretty standard industry terms and are likely the same even if you’re a maverick and went with some other provider.\nOnce you’ve picked your provider, it has two jobs: Collecting subscriptions, and sending emails. I’ll hit the vocab of each for you.\nCollecting Subscriptions At some point, you need to show a little box to a potential subscriber that they can put their email address in.\nSignup Form If you already have a website, you’ll want to put that magic box on it. Probably somewhere at the top of the page, if not the very top. If you head over to iangmcdowell.com you\u0026rsquo;ll see a signup form offering my reader magnet, The Boreas Gap. I sell that sucker for $.99 on Amazon, it\u0026rsquo;s a good offer.\nIf you run a blog on your website, you may also want to put a signup form popup on it. You’ve probably seen these surfing the web; you\u0026rsquo;re halfway through an article when a little nag pops up asking you to subscribe. You could be that asshole.\nLanding Page Even if you don’t have a website, you can still collect signups. Services like MailerLite allow you to create a “Landing Page” that tells potential subscribers about your mailing list and holds that all-important signup form. They provide sweet templates for making it look good, and even take care of the hosting. All you have to do is figure out how to get people to go look at it.\nSubscriber Groups You can group your subscribers for fine-grained email sending. As an author, you are unlikely to need this. Stick to one group until you have a good reason to do otherwise.\nMailing Subscribers Your emails will fall into one of two broad groups. Proactive mailing via campaigns (e.g. announcing a new book), and reactive mailing via automation (e.g. sending your reader magnet when someone subscribes).\nCampaign A Campaign here just means “an email.” You can use the provided templates to build something slick announcing your book. Then you decide which of your subscribers you want to get it (all of them), and when you want them to get it (probably 9AM or 2PM, on a Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday). If you have loads of subscribers you could consider sending it to different folks at different times to see what works best.\nAutomation I have already said this a billion times, but the #1 thing you’re going to want to do is send your reader magnet when the user signs up for your list. Automation is the way.\nAutomations have a ‘Trigger’, and an associated email. For a reader magnet, you’ll use either the “When subscriber joins a group” trigger or “When subscriber completes a form.”\nNext, you’ll add an ‘Email’ to the workflow. Build a simple email that thanks your reader for joining the list, gets them excited about the reader magnet, and includes a link to download the reader magnet. You’re done. You just automated something\nWrap up Whew. That’s a big info dump on mailing lists. I hope I\u0026rsquo;ve provided you with the basics to get started. Have a question I didn\u0026rsquo;t address?
